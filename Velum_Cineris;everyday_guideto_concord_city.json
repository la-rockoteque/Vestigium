                            "The Aestari are the very embodiment of refinement, their forms sculpted with an almost unnatural precision. Their beauty is undeniable, yet there is something unsettling about their symmetry—something too perfect, too deliberate. Every aspect of their appearance suggests careful design rather than natural evolution.\n\nTheir skin tones span a striking spectrum, from porcelain white to deep onyx, often carrying an unnatural smoothness. Some Aestari seem to shimmer faintly under artificial light, their complexions subtly shifting to match their surroundings. Their hair is equally extraordinary, flowing in shades of platinum, jet black, blood-red, or even metallic hues like silver, gold, or copper. It moves as if weightless, resisting the effects of wind and gravity in ways that defy explanation.\n\nThe most distinctive feature of the Aestari, however, is their eyes. Reflective like polished glass, their irises capture and refract light in strange ways, often glowing softly in dim environments. In neon-lit cityscapes, their gaze mirrors the filtered lights around them, shifting in color and intensity. Even in darkness, their eyes gleam with an unnatural radiance, making it impossible to ignore their presence.\n\nTheir physiques, while varied, always retain an air of elegance. Whether towering and statuesque or lean and wiry, their movements are deliberate—measured, efficient, and impossibly smooth. Some seem to glide rather than walk, their steps unnaturally silent. Others hold themselves with an effortless poise, commanding attention without a single wasted motion.\n\nThough their outward forms radiate perfection, there is an eerie lack of imperfections. No blemishes, no stray hairs, no idle fidgeting. Their expressions are precise, their emotions calculated. Even their breath seems regulated, each inhale and exhale controlled. It is this very flawlessness that makes them unsettling—an uncanny beauty that feels just a little too engineered.\n\nTo the untrained eye, the Aestari may seem like an elite class of humans, their presence exuding wealth, power, and control. But look closer, and the differences become clear. Their elegance is not just aesthetic—it is fundamental, woven into the very core of their being. Whether they were shaped by natural evolution or something else entirely remains a mystery, but one thing is certain:\n\nThe Aestari are not like the others."

In towering corporate spires, arcane enclaves, and palatial estates, the Aestari flourish as both architects and rulers of society. Their culture is steeped in elitism, built upon generations of meticulous self-improvement, both physically and intellectually.\n\nDespite their seeming unity, the Aestari do not form monolithic societies.

The roles they adopt are not merely professions but expressions of identity, meticulously chosen to suit their strengths and ambitions. While outsiders may see them as cold or calculating, the Aestari view their structured society as a work of art—each individual a carefully placed stroke on the canvas of civilization.\n\nArbiters of Influence: The highest echelon of Aestari society consists of strategists, diplomats, and financiers. They do not govern openly but control the systems that shape reality—economic structures, magical pacts, and political dealings. Their words are law, not by decree, but by the sheer weight of their presence.\n\nCurators of Perfection: Aestari artisans, scholars, and geneticists work tirelessly to refine their species, crafting everything from philosophical treatises on beauty to biological enhancements that sustain their immaculate appearances. To them, the pursuit of mastery is not merely academic—it is sacred.\n\nGhosts of the Halls: Some Aestari embrace the art of being unseen. These are the spymasters, enforcers, and assassins, those who operate in shadows but never linger in them. Their existence is a contradiction—both invisible and unforgettable, the whisper of a name that cannot be traced.\n\nThe Untouched: Among the elite, there exists a sect of Aestari who reject labor entirely. Their role is to exist as paragons, symbols of their species’ supremacy. These figures—whether nobility, figureheads, or deified corporate scions—are untouchable, above the concerns of mortality.\n\nRegardless of their place in the hierarchy, all Aestari share a singular philosophy: to falter is to be forgotten."

Each name is chosen with intent—whether to convey power, refinement, or an impression of mystique.\n\nTraditional Names:\nThese names are fluid, carrying a melodic quality that seems purposefully cultivated to linger in the mind. Many Aestari prefer longer, flowing names that sound as if they belong to a lineage of consequence.\n\nExamples: Caelithar, Orisyn, Veythiel, Lysara, Xalendir, Sylthorin, Naevara.\nModern Aestari Names:\nIn contemporary circles, some Aestari adopt names that blend seamlessly into high society, evoking refinement, charm, and quiet authority. These names often have soft vowels, flowing syllables, and a hint of aristocratic elegance.\n\nExamples: Adrian, Lucien, Sylas, Julian, Victor, Cassian, Evander, Dorian, Alistair, Raphael\nFor feminine names: Celeste, Liliane, Seraphine, Evelyne, Selene, Vivienne, Ophelia, Isadora, Camilla, Elise\nSurnames & House Names:\nOver generations, many Aestari surnames have faded, lost to time or deliberately shed as their holders sought to redefine themselves. Some still retain their ancestral house names, while others have adopted sleek, modern surnames that blend effortlessly into contemporary high society.\n\nCommon Surnames: Many Aestari have taken on surnames that feel refined but understated, subtly hinting at lineage without the weight of old traditions.\nExamples: Voss, Calloway, DaCosta, Alden, Mercer, Durant, Faulkner, Lennox, Sinclair, Everard, Marquette\nHouse Names:\nThe few Aestari who still claim their noble heritage often retain their house names, which still carry the resonance of old power and deep tradition. These names are often longer, more ornate, and evoke the classical elegance of their culture.\n\nExamples: Val’Kaeron, Orthelias, Sythrin, Vel’Thalor, Elaris, Ael’Veyr, Zarentis, Caelthorne, Lysandral, Vor’Tyrian\nNaming Conventions:\nMany Aestari use both their modern surname and house name when signing official documents or presenting themselves formally, a nod to both pragmatism and legacy.\n\nExample: Adrian Voss of House Vel’Thalor\nExample: Liliane Calloway of House Orthelias"

                            "To the people of Concord City, the Aestari are not merely a species—they are an institution, a living testament to power, refinement, and control. Whether as corporate executives, noble elites, or influential strategists, the Aestari shape the city’s destiny from above, never deigning to tread the streets below unless necessity demands it.  \n\nTheir presence is most prominent in the upper echelons—towering spires of glass\n\nand gold, private estates fortified by wealth and legacy, boardrooms where decisions shape the fate of entire districts. The influence of an Aestari is rarely seen directly; instead, it is felt in policies, stock markets, and whispered negotiations behind closed doors.  \n\n### Elitism as a Birthright  \nThe Aestari’s societal structure in Concord City is one of exclusivity. To be born Aestari is to be born above others—a truth they rarely dispute. They dominate the megacorporations, aristocratic circles, and high academia, treating politics as a game of precision, where \n\nthey move the pieces without ever stepping onto the board themselves.  \n\n- **Mega-Corporate Dominance:** Many Aestari own or control the most powerful megacorporations in Concord City, shaping the economy from the highest offices. They are CEOs, financiers, tech moguls, and silent partners, ensuring that wealth flows in the direction they dictate.  \n\n- **Noble Houses of Old:** While nobility is no longer the absolute power it once was, the Aestari houses maintain their legacy through influence rather than force. Their estates still loom over the cityscape, their crests etched into the architecture of history itself.  \n\n- **The Few Lowborn:** Unlike other species, the concept of a lowborn Aestari is nearly nonexistent. Few are ever born outside wealth or influence, and those that are often find themselves absorbed into the system—either through patronage, corporate assimilation, or the unrelenting pressure to excel. A lowborn Aestari who does not rise is an anomaly, and such anomalies tend not to last long.\n\n### The Unseen Game  \nDespite their overwhelming influence, the Aestari are rarely seen among the common people. They do not mingle in the streets, nor do they concern themselves with the everyday struggles of the lower classes. To them, Concord City is a grand machine, and they are its architects, not its workers.  \n\nIf an Aestari is seen outside the gilded towers or private lounges, it is not by accident. They are there with purpose, whether to negotiate, observe, or eliminate obstacles. To cross an Aestari in Concord City is to risk exile, economic ruin, or worse—and no one ever sees the hand that delivers the blow.  \n\nIn Concord City, the Aestari do not rule by decree. They do not need to.  \n\nThey rule by the simple, unquestioned fact of their existence."

The roles they adopt are not merely professions but expressions of identity, meticulously chosen to suit their strengths and ambitions. While outsiders may see them as cold or calculating, the Aestari view their structured society as a work of art—each individual a carefully placed stroke on the canvas of civilization.\n\nArbiters of Influence: The highest echelon of Aestari society consists of strategists, diplomats, and financiers. They do not govern openly but control the systems that shape reality—economic structures, magical pacts, and political dealings. Their words are law, not by decree, but by the sheer weight of their presence.\n\nCurators of Perfection: Aestari artisans, scholars, and geneticists work tirelessly to refine their species, crafting everything from philosophical treatises on beauty to biological enhancements that sustain their immaculate appearances. To them, the pursuit of mastery is not merely academic—it is sacred.\n\nGhosts of the Halls: Some Aestari embrace the art of being unseen. These are the spymasters, enforcers, and assassins, those who operate in shadows but never linger in them. Their existence is a contradiction—both invisible and unforgettable, the whisper of a name that cannot be traced.\n\nThe Untouched: Among the elite, there exists a sect of Aestari who reject labor entirely. Their role is to exist as paragons, symbols of their species’ supremacy. These figures—whether nobility, figureheads, or deified corporate scions—are untouchable, above the concerns of mortality.\n\nRegardless of their place in the hierarchy, all Aestari share a singular philosophy: to falter is to be forgotten."

                            "Aestari names reflect their obsession with elegance, tradition, and control. Their naming conventions are built on symmetry, soft consonants, and flowing syllables. Each name is chosen with intent—whether to convey power, refinement, or an impression of mystique.\n\nTraditional Names:\nThese names are fluid, carrying a melodic quality that seems purposefully cultivated to linger in the mind. Many Aestari prefer longer, flowing names that sound as if they belong to a lineage of consequence.\n\nExamples: Caelithar, Orisyn, Veythiel, Lysara, Xalendir, Sylthorin, Naevara.\nModern Aestari Names:\nIn contemporary circles, some Aestari adopt names that blend seamlessly into high society, evoking refinement, charm, and quiet authority. These names often have soft vowels, flowing syllables, and a hint of aristocratic elegance.\n\nExamples: Adrian, Lucien, Sylas, Julian, Victor, Cassian, Evander, Dorian, Alistair, Raphael\nFor feminine names: Celeste, Liliane, Seraphine, Evelyne, Selene, Vivienne, Ophelia, Isadora, Camilla, Elise\nSurnames & House Names:\nOver generations, many Aestari surnames have faded, lost to time or deliberately shed as their holders sought to redefine themselves. Some still retain their ancestral house names, while others have adopted sleek, modern surnames that blend effortlessly into contemporary high society.\n\nCommon Surnames: Many Aestari have taken on surnames that feel refined but understated, subtly hinting at lineage without the weight of old traditions.\nExamples: Voss, Calloway, DaCosta, Alden, Mercer, Durant, Faulkner, Lennox, Sinclair, Everard, Marquette\nHouse Names:\nThe few Aestari who still claim their noble heritage often retain their house names, which still carry the resonance of old power and deep tradition. These names are often longer, more ornate, and evoke the classical elegance of their culture.\n\nExamples: Val’Kaeron, Orthelias, Sythrin, Vel’Thalor, Elaris, Ael’Veyr, Zarentis, Caelthorne, Lysandral, Vor’Tyrian\nNaming Conventions:\nMany Aestari use both their modern surname and house name when signing official documents or presenting themselves formally, a nod to both pragmatism and legacy.\n\nExample: Adrian Voss of House Vel’Thalor\nExample: Liliane Calloway of House Orthelias"

They appeared without warning, dazed, lost, and claiming to come from another world. But no one believed them.  \n\nAt first, people thought they were anomalies, or a failed corporate experiment gone wrong. The world gaslighted them into doubt, convincing them that their memories were false, a shared delusion of a people who had simply never existed before.  \n\nOver the years, their past faded into uncertainty. The first generation of humans—The Lost Generation—are now old, weary, and unsure if they ever truly had another home. Some still cling to fragmented memories of places that no one else remembers, while others have given up, convinced that they must have always been here, no matter how much it doesn’t make sense.  \n\nBut the Emergent Generation—their children—never had another world. They were born in Concord City, yet they are not treated as part of it. They inherit the changed nature of their parents—the bodies and minds reshaped by whatever force took humanity away and brought them back different.  \n\nThey are not anomalies.

Their skin tones, hair colors, and eye shades span a broad spectrum, but nothing about them suggests a unifying genetic marker beyond basic humanoid traits. However, subtle differences remain, hinting at their anomalous origins.\n\nThose who were part of The Emergence, the Lost Generation, tend to carry an air of unease, their faces lined with exhaustion. Their expressions are often distant, as if they are searching for something they can no longer name. Some exhibit small quirks—fingers twitching unconsciously, eyes shifting slightly out of sync with their reflections, voices carrying a barely perceptible echo in empty rooms.\n\nThe Emergent Generation, those born in Concord City, appear more grounded. They do not share the haunted looks of their parents, but many still experience strange phenomena—vivid dreams of places they have never been, an uncanny sense of familiarity with people they have never met, and an instinctive wariness of things they cannot explain.\n\nThough physically indistinguishable from a standard humanoid template, one fact remains certain: humans should not exist, and yet, they do.\n"

Humans were labeled as anomalies, an accident of reality that had no rightful place in the world. Conspiracies swirled—some believed them to be the result of a failed corporate experiment, others thought they were precursors to an impending catastrophe. Whatever the truth, the world agreed on one thing: humans were not supposed to be here.\n\nOver time, however, their presence became an accepted part of Concord City. The initial hostility faded into neglect, and they were gradually absorbed into the lowest rungs of society. The Lost Generation, still clinging to fractured memories, found themselves working menial jobs, scavenging for meaning in a world that had no place for them. Meanwhile, the Emergent Generation, lacking any past but the one given to them, adapted quickly—learning, working, and carving out a future that did not rely on the weight of lost history.\n\nDespite this adaptation, humans remain outsiders. They are tolerated but rarely respected, allowed to exist but never truly welcomed. Many have embraced their outsider status, forming tight-knit communities where the past is whispered about in half-remembered fragments. Others attempt to integrate, striving to climb the social ladder in a city that still sees them as aberrations. And then,\n{{pageNumber,auto}}\n\\page\nthere are those who question everything—who refuse to accept the world as it is and seek to uncover the truth of what happened forty years ago.\n"

However, these cases are rare, and their success is often met with quiet resentment from the species that see themselves as the rightful rulers of the city. For every human that ascends, there are a dozen more struggling to prove their worth in a world that has already dismissed them.\n\nRumors persist of underground human movements—groups dedicated to uncovering the truth of The Emergence, or worse, seeking ways to return to the place they believe they once belonged. Whether these groups pose a genuine threat or are simply the desperate dreams of a displaced people is unclear, but authorities keep a wary eye on any human who asks too many questions.\n"

Over time, naming conventions have evolved in two directions: \n\n- Traditional Names: These are the names carried by the Lost Generation, remnants of a past that may or may not have existed. They include names like *Jonathan, Michael, Sarah, Emily, David, Maria, Thomas, and Rachel*.\n- Modern Names: The Emergent Generation, born without the burden of lost history, often take names that reflect their new world. These names are shorter, punchier, and sometimes adapted from other cultures. Examples include *Lex, Juno, Cas, Orion, Vex, Mina, Arlo, and Jace*.\n- Surnames: The concept of surnames has been largely abandoned among humans. Some retain the last names of their Emergent ancestors, while others adopt new ones based on their professions or affiliations. Some, particularly among the lower class, go without one entirely, existing as singular identities in a city that barely acknowledges them.\n\n"

In the workforce, they are reliable laborers, willing to endure hardship for the promise of a better future. And in the shadows, they move with purpose, seeking answers that no one else dares to ask.\n\nFor forty years, humanity has survived in Concord City. But survival is no longer enough.

Often relegated to forgotten industrial sectors, condemned housing blocks, or unstable utility caverns, their existence is precarious but fiercely self-sufficient. They form tight working crews, often operating outside official infrastructure, repairing what the city abandons and reclaiming what others call waste.\n\nThey avoid the elven aristocracy and corporate towers unless contract-bound, and treat A.S.T.R.A.L. operatives with a blend of wary respect and deep-rooted suspicion. Paranormal zones don’t scare them—they’ve lived their whole lives in unnatural places.\n\nKorraks rarely gather in large numbers unless something catastrophic is happening. When they do, it’s never peaceful—and it’s never forgotten."

                            "The Aestari are the very embodiment of refinement, their forms sculpted with an almost unnatural precision. Their beauty is undeniable, yet there is something unsettling about their symmetry—something too perfect, too deliberate. Every aspect of their appearance suggests careful design rather than natural evolution.\n\nTheir skin tones span a striking spectrum, from porcelain white to deep onyx, often carrying an unnatural smoothness. Some Aestari seem to shimmer faintly under artificial light, their complexions subtly shifting to match their surroundings. Their hair is equally extraordinary, flowing in shades of platinum, jet black, blood-red, or even metallic hues like silver, gold, or copper. It moves as if weightless, resisting the effects of wind and gravity in ways that defy explanation.\n\nThe most distinctive feature of the Aestari, however, is their eyes. Reflective like polished glass, their irises capture and refract light in strange ways, often glowing softly in dim environments. In neon-lit cityscapes, their gaze mirrors the filtered lights around them, shifting in color and intensity. Even in darkness, their eyes gleam with an unnatural radiance, making it impossible to ignore their presence.\n\nTheir physiques, while varied, always retain an air of elegance. Whether towering and statuesque or lean and wiry, their movements are deliberate—measured, efficient, and impossibly smooth. Some seem to glide rather than walk, their steps unnaturally silent. Others hold themselves with an effortless poise, commanding attention without a single wasted motion.\n\nThough their outward forms radiate perfection, there is an eerie lack of imperfections. No blemishes, no stray hairs, no idle fidgeting. Their expressions are precise, their emotions calculated. Even their breath seems regulated, each inhale and exhale controlled. It is this very flawlessness that makes them unsettling—an uncanny beauty that feels just a little too engineered.\n\nTo the untrained eye, the Aestari may seem like an elite class of humans, their presence exuding wealth, power, and control. But look closer, and the differences become clear. Their elegance is not just aesthetic—it is fundamental, woven into the very core of their being. Whether they were shaped by natural evolution or something else entirely remains a mystery, but one thing is certain:\n\nThe Aestari are not like the others."

The roles they adopt are not merely professions but expressions of identity, meticulously chosen to suit their strengths and ambitions. While outsiders may see them as cold or calculating, the Aestari view their structured society as a work of art—each individual a carefully placed stroke on the canvas of civilization.\n\nArbiters of Influence: The highest echelon of Aestari society consists of strategists, diplomats, and financiers. They do not govern openly but control the systems that shape reality—economic structures, magical pacts, and political dealings. Their words are law, not by decree, but by the sheer weight of their presence.\n\nCurators of Perfection: Aestari artisans, scholars, and geneticists work tirelessly to refine their species, crafting everything from philosophical treatises on beauty to biological enhancements that sustain their immaculate appearances. To them, the pursuit of mastery is not merely academic—it is sacred.\n\nGhosts of the Halls: Some Aestari embrace the art of being unseen. These are the spymasters, enforcers, and assassins, those who operate in shadows but never linger in them. Their existence is a contradiction—both invisible and unforgettable, the whisper of a name that cannot be traced.\n\nThe Untouched: Among the elite, there exists a sect of Aestari who reject labor entirely. Their role is to exist as paragons, symbols of their species’ supremacy. These figures—whether nobility, figureheads, or deified corporate scions—are untouchable, above the concerns of mortality.\n\nRegardless of their place in the hierarchy, all Aestari share a singular philosophy: to falter is to be forgotten."

These names often have soft vowels, flowing syllables, and a hint of aristocratic elegance.\n\nExamples: Adrian, Lucien, Sylas, Julian, Victor, Cassian, Evander, Dorian, Alistair, Raphael\nFor feminine names: Celeste, Liliane, Seraphine, Evelyne, Selene, Vivienne, Ophelia, Isadora, Camilla, Elise\nSurnames & House Names:\nOver generations, many Aestari surnames have faded, lost to time or deliberately shed as their holders sought to redefine themselves. Some still retain their ancestral house names, while others have adopted sleek, modern surnames that blend effortlessly into contemporary high society.\n\nCommon Surnames: Many Aestari have taken on surnames that feel refined but understated, subtly hinting at lineage without the weight of old traditions.\nExamples: Voss, Calloway, DaCosta, Alden, Mercer, Durant, Faulkner, Lennox, Sinclair, Everard, Marquette\nHouse Names:\nThe few Aestari who still claim their noble heritage often retain their house names, which still carry the resonance of old power and deep tradition. These names are often longer, more ornate, and evoke the classical elegance of their culture.\n\nExamples: Val’Kaeron, Orthelias, Sythrin, Vel’Thalor, Elaris, Ael’Veyr, Zarentis, Caelthorne, Lysandral, Vor’Tyrian\nNaming Conventions:\nMany Aestari use both their modern surname and house name when signing official documents or presenting themselves formally, a nod to both pragmatism and legacy.\n\nExample: Adrian Voss of House Vel’Thalor\nExample: Liliane Calloway of House Orthelias"

His eyes were empty. His notes described “the whispering ones” and warned: “Some light doesn’t show where we are—it shows what we’ve lost.”\n\nSome believe this spell doesn’t just illuminate—it invites observation from elsewhere."

The familiar is alive in magical essence but exists only as a moving design on your flesh.\n\nWhile the familiar is inkbound, you gain the following benefits:- You can see and hear through the familiar as long as it is on a visible part of your body (such as your arm, hand, or face). While using its senses, you are deaf and blind to your own surroundings.- You can communicate telepathically with the familiar while it remains tattooed on you and is conscious.- When you cast a spell with a range of touch, the familiar can deliver the spell through you if the body part bearing the tattoo is used to make contact with the target.- The familiar cannot attack, interact with objects, or move independently from your body. It can crawl across your skin, shifting its location and appearance, but it cannot leave your surface.- The tattoo cannot be removed by mundane means and persists even if you are polymorphed or disguised. If the tattoo is destroyed or erased by magical means (such as dispel magic or a targeted ritual), the familiar is banished and must be recreated by casting this spell again.\n\nThe familiar’s design changes subtly to reflect its emotions or magical stimuli, often revealing moods, warnings, or arcane patterns.\n\nYou can only have one inkbound familiar at a time. Attempting to cast this spell again causes the previous tattoo to fade and the familiar to vanish."

The magic doesn’t extract facts—it invites revelation.\n\nA silken mirage unfolds, where the subject’s soul steps forward, cloaked in glimmering honesty. Faces, forms, emotions, and gestures emerge from the haze—some familiar, some unknown—each representing a truth they’ve always carried.\n\nThe spell may reveal one or more of the following aspects, depending on your focus:\n\nGender Identity: The target's inner identity manifests briefly as a mirage, affirming their true self. This may reveal identities such as Male, Female, Nonbinary, Transgender, Cisgender, Two- Spirit, Genderfluid, Agender, or something uniquely celebrityl and beyond typical categories.\n\nRomantic Inclination: You awaken a subtle echo within the target’s spirit, reflecting their romantic nature. This might indicate whether they identify as Hyper- Romantic, Romantic, Demi- Romantic, Grayromantic, Aromantic, or something entirely undefined.\n\nSexual Orientation: A fleeting, sensory dreamscape gently unfolds around the target, reflecting their deepest attractions. They may acknowledge, embrace, or gently dismiss these visions. The spell doesn't impose new desires; it simply illuminates those already present.\n\nPosition Preference: A subtle sensation reveals the subject's preferred intimacy position, such as Top, Bottom, Versatile, Vers- Top, Vers- Bottom, Side, or an unclassified, uniquely celebrityl preference.\n\nFetish Affinity: A delicate hum pulses into the subject’s subconscious, drawing forth hidden motifs of pleasure—those they cherish, those they deny, and those that whisper only in dreams. This may reveal affinities such as Bondage, Impact Play, Sensory Deprivation, Exhibitionism, Voyeurism, Power Exchange, Pet Play, or something undocumented by common texts.\n\nKink Role Alignment: A soft whisper coils through the subject’s awareness, coaxing insight into their innate position within dominance- submission dynamics. They may momentarily experience themselves in a state of control, surrender, or fluidity. Whether they resist, acknowledge, or embrace this vision, the spell merely opens a door—it does not push them through it.\n\nThe experience is not invasive—it is affirming, deeply celebrityl, and laced with quiet reverence. The subject may resist this unveiling with a Wisdom saving throw; on a success, the vision remains fragmented, and only a vague sense of their essence slips through.\n\nThis spell does not coerce. It does not judge. It simply illuminates what was already burning softly beneath the surface.",
                "This spell respects the target's autonomy and does not alter or coerce identities or preferences; it merely reveals truths already held.\n\nAlways ensure sensitive handling of these revelations at your table, prioritizing player comfort and respectful roleplay."

The first time each creature enters or starts its turn on the turf, it must make another Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 electric damage and suffer static shock- induced disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll or ability check it makes before the end of its next turn.- The grass is obviously unnatural and makes loud squeaking sounds when stepped on.

The mosquito appears within 5 feet of the most important person in the area (DM’s discretion) and begins an aggressive buzzing and biting campaign.\n- If Summon Pest is cast again: Pest- 1 is not duplicated. It simply relocates to the new target, abandoning the old one unless they are still within 30 feet of the new caster, in which case it harasses both.\n- If no suitable target exists: Pest- 1 vanishes into non- space until summoned again.\n- If the target becomes untargetable (e.g., invisible, banished): Pest- 1 immediately shifts to the next most “important” person in the room.\n- If someone other than the original caster uses the spell: Pest- 1 recognizes this and updates its priorities accordingly, often begrudgingly.\n\nMechanical Effect:\nThe affected creature is considered distracted for 1 minute:\n- Disadvantage on concentration checks.\n- Cannot benefit from the Invisible condition.\n- Any attack rolls made against the creature have advantage if they rely on sound or movement (e.g., tremorsense or blindsight)."

On a failed save, the target becomes charmed, treating you as a trusted authority figure, willing to comply with most non- hostile requests and instructions.\n\nWhile charmed, the target experiences a strong compulsion to remain within 10 feet of you. At the end of each of its turns, the target may repeat the Wisdom saving throw (without disadvantage); success allows it to move freely until the start of its next turn.\n\nThe charm persists indefinitely until it is dispelled, you become hostile toward the target, or the target takes damage."

He follows basic combat tactics, focusing on protecting you or the group, but is self- serving and won’t risk his life for anyone’s cause unless it directly benefits him. He will act once in combat, and his loyalty ends as soon as the fight is over.\n\nAdditional effects:- He insists on being paid in gold, and if not, he may hold grudges that result in negative consequences for future interactions.- After the fight concludes, the mobster vanishes mysteriously, leaving behind a feeling of “unfinished business.”"

The mark grows stronger with repeated uses. You experience minor, unsettling phenomena:\n- Your reflection occasionally blinks or moves independently.\n- Your shadow periodically misaligns or lags behind your physical form.\n\nAfter you cast this spell 3 or more times, you gain disadvantage on Charisma saving throws until you complete a long rest, as the magic slowly erodes your own identity.\n\nThese effects are cumulative but subtle enough to be hidden from casual observers—though those familiar with the Void’s whispers will recognize your affliction immediately.\n\nRemoving the Mark:\nA Greater Restoration or similarly potent cleansing magic removes all accumulated marks from you, resetting the count."

You and up to 5 willing creatures see a ghostly reenactment of the creature’s final moments, projected like a spectral recording. The scene is silent and incomplete, but may reveal useful visual details such as a killer's face, a hidden object, or a symbol drawn in blood.\n \n- Lingering Instinct. You gain a skill or tool proficiency the deceased possessed (your choice, if known) for 10 minutes. You also gain advantage on Intelligence checks related to the creature's past profession or knowledge.\n\n- Emotional Imprint. The space is saturated with the creature's strongest emotion at the time of death. For 10 minutes, anyone entering the space must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or experience that emotion intensely (e.g., rage, fear, sorrow), which may affect social interactions, Insight, or Intimidation checks.\n\nThe echo fades once the chosen effect ends, or if dismissed early."

On a success, they take half damage.\n\nWhile the damage is instant, the wound is not: \n- If the creature survives, their shadow refuses to follow their movements for 1 hour. \n- Affected creatures cannot be healed by magical means until the start of your next turn. \n- If this spell reduces a creature to 0 HP, they vanish silently—no body, no mark, only a lingering echo of their name.\n- The target cannot be hidden from magical detection (such as *Ghost Circuit* or *Giocrin’s Hunt*). \n- If they speak, their voice echoes unnaturally, revealing their position to any creature within 60 feet.\n\nFor 1 minute after taking damage from this spell, the target becomes crystalline within. Whenever they take radiation, cognitive, or chiaric damage, roll a d4. On a 1, the damage is reflected onto a random creature within 10 feet instead, as internal refractions lash outward unpredictably.\n\nFracture Point: If the creature is reduced to 0 hit points by this spell, they break into dust- fine crystal, leaving behind only a single perfect diamond worth 100 credit (tainted with residual dread).\n\n\nAt the end of the duration, the crystals dissolve harmlessly, leaving only lingering static in their nervous system."

Her form towers beyond mortal comprehension—a vast, living structure whose roots spread unseen beneath the world, entwining with Terra, her twin, while her branches stretch into the skies, weaving the ever-changing currents of life.\n\nGaïa does not rule, nor does she intervene—she endures. She is the breath between the birth and death of all things, the silent witness to an endless cycle of creation and decay. Through her, the land flourishes and withers, forests rise and fall, and the seasons march ever forward, unmoved by the will of gods or mortals.\n\nHer bond with Terra is inseparable, yet their natures are not the same. While Terra embodies stability and the enduring foundation, Gaïa is the restless force of renewal—the wildfire that makes way for new growth, the flood that reshapes the land, the cycle that never halts.\n\nThose who revere Gaïa do not seek comfort—they seek understanding. To walk her path is to embrace the truth that life does not yield, but it does change. One must bend with the storm, adapt with the seasons, and grow through the hardships that shape all living things."

If Gaïa is the pulse of change, Terra is the unyielding root of stability—the presence that ensures there will always be ground to stand upon.\n\nForged from Véa’s stability, Terra is an anchor in the great Tension, the point upon which all cycles turn. He is not simply a god of growth, but of structure, of persistence, and of eternal return. His form is unseen, but his influence is felt in the unshaken mountains, the steady erosion of rivers, the eternal cycle of death feeding new life.\n\nUnlike his twin Gaïa, Terra does not embrace the wild chaos of adaptation. He is the guardian of balance, the force that ensures cycles continue rather than spiral into oblivion. Those who follow Terra do not seek to change their fate, but to endure it.\n\nTerra and Gaïa are forever intertwined, yet eternally distinct. Where she pushes forward, he remains steadfast. Where she burns to give birth anew, he ensures the ashes do not scatter into nothing. He is not opposed to change, but without his presence, change would consume itself.\n\nTo worship Terra is to accept the burdens of time, to endure hardship as a passage to wisdom, and to understand that all things return. His lessons are not those of comfort, but of resilience—a belief that nothing is lost, only reshaped."

Victory, to her faithful, is **not merely taking—but earning**."

His is the power of patience and inevitability, the wisdom of cycles, the acceptance of change as a path to greater understanding. Though they oppose one another, neither can truly overcome the other—for without night, there is no dawn.  \n\nZebulon's influence is felt in the hush of twilight, the stillness of dreams, the gentle ripples of a moonlit lake.

Philosophers, seekers, and mystics walk the paths of the night, knowing that under the Moon’s gaze, all things are revealed in time.  \n\nTo walk in the light of Zebulon is to embrace the unseen, listen to the silence, and seek wisdom in the shadows."

Once the Greater gods found out they tossed him off the top of Olympus and comdemned him to fall for eternity into the bottomless abyss.

His symbol is actually forgotten but from some very old people who would not dare writing it nowhere."

Wielding a mighty double-bladed axe in each hand, his proud, silvery beard cascades over his broad chest, marking him as a true paragon of dwarven might.\n\nDespite his ascension to godhood, Dravemir's story is intimately intertwined with that of his rival, Druquenein.

Her appearance captivates with scales that shimmer in ever-shifting hues of silver and azure, reminiscent of a twilight sky filled with whispered secrets. Her eyes, vast and luminous as the stars, reflect not moral judgments but a boundless curiosity about the desires of those who seek her.\n\nUnlike the benevolent deities, Ova is driven by an insatiable interest in the stories and outcomes of mortal lives. She grants wishes not purely out of kindness, but from a deep fascination with the myriad ways in which these desires can alter the tapestry of reality. Her capricious nature means that whether a granted wish brings fortune or folly, it serves to satiate her thirst for understanding the complex webs of fate and ambition.\n\nWorshipped by those who are willing to embrace uncertainty and risk, Ova's followers are as varied as their wishes, motivated by the intriguing allure of possibilities she offers. Their devotion is marked not by acts of purity, but by a willingness to explore the edges of potential, creating a dynamic relationship with a goddess who delights in the unexpected turns of destiny."

                "Ezhoxorh, the formidable God of Plagues, Pestilence, and Nefarious Insects, is a deity whose presence heralds chaos and decay. Cloaked in swirling shadows, Ezhoxorh commands a terrifying force that reflects the untamed power of nature's darkest aspects. Clouds of virulent miasma surround them, casting an ominous gloom wherever they tread.\n\nEzhoxorh's influence is far-reaching; they are the harbinger of swarms that blot out the sun, carrying with them disease and destruction. These nefarious insects are extensions of Ezhoxorh’s will, spreading pestilence and laying waste to the lands they scourge.\n\nTheir role in the pantheon is one of dread and caution, a reminder of the thin line between order and chaos. Oaths are whispered in their name to stave off their wrath, for Ezhoxorh's dominion stands as both a testament to nature's might and a warning of the havoc wrought by unchecked decay."

This bond transforms the forgotten machine into an extension of your own body—enhancing your defenses, weaponry, and mobility when you enter mech mode.\n\n## Benefits While in Mech Mode\n\n- **Enhanced Armor:** \n While piloting your mech, your Armor Class becomes 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus as the mech’s sturdy frame absorbs blows that would otherwise harm you.\n\n- **Integrated Weaponry:** \n Your mech is outfitted with basic energy and melee weapons. You may use its attack options in place of your celebrityl attacks. The mech’s damage die is determined by your level (see *Psyblade Damage Die Progression* table for similar scaling), and you can use your mech’s attacks to deliver additional effects granted by your class features.\n\n- **Augmented Mobility:** \n The mech’s boosters grant you superior movement in urban combat. You gain advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks to climb, and your jump distance increases by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus.\n\n- **Interface Protocols:** \n Your bond with the mech unlocks a series of specialized maneuvers:\n \n- **Overdrive (Level 5 feature):** \n Once per short rest, you can enter overdrive mode. For 1 minute, your mech’s attacks deal an extra 1d6 damage and you move an additional 10 feet on your turn.\n \n- **Coolant Flush (Level 7 feature):** \n As a bonus action, you can expel the mech’s built‑up heat to dispel one condition affecting either you or the mech. This can be done once per long rest.\n \n- **Lockstep Anchor (Level 10 feature):** \n When making a melee attack in mech mode, you can anchor the mech to its target, giving you advantage on saving throws against effects that would knock you prone or move you against your will until the start of your next turn.\n\n"
