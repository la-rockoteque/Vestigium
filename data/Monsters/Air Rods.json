Evasive Maneuvering. The Air Rod has advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that would cause it to be targeted or hit, as it can swiftly change direction in the air.
Temporal Shift. As a being that exists between moments, the Air Rod can phase through physical barriers, allowing it to move through objects and creatures without provoking opportunity attacks.
Actions
Temporal Flicker. Melee Attack: +4 to hit, melee attack dealing 5 (1d6 + 2) force damage. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or have disadvantage on its next attack roll due to the disorienting effect of the Air Rod's swift movements.
Airborne Surge. Ranged Attack: +4 to hit, ranged attack dealing 5 (1d6 + 2) lightning damage. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn as the jolt of electricity disrupts its senses.
