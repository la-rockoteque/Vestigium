Evasive Presence. The Babushka Lady has advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that would cause her to be restrained or incapacitated.
Mysterious Aura. Creatures that start their turn within 10 feet of the Babushka Lady must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 13) or be charmed until the end of their next turn.
Spellcasting. The Babushka Lady is a 6th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). She has the following spells prepared: Cantrips (at will): mage hand, minor illusion, toll the dead. 1st level (4 slots): charm person, dissonant whispers, shield. 2nd level (3 slots): mirror image, hold person. 3rd level (3 slots): fear, counterspell.
Actions
Cursed Grasp. Melee Attack: +5 to hit, dealing 6 (1d6 + 3) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have its speed reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.
Whispers of Despair. The Babushka Lady can target one creature she can see within 30 feet, instilling a sense of dread. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn, becoming incapacitated if it fails.
Soul Siphon. The Babushka Lady can use her connection with the tortured souls to severely harm a creature affected by Cursed Grasp or a willing creature. The target must make a DC 15 saving throw, taking 32 (5d10 + 5) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.
Veil of Shadows. The Babushka Lady can use an action to envelop herself in magical shadows, becoming near-invulnerable. While in this state, she cannot affect other creatures, but she is immune to all damage. This state lasts until the start of her next turn, or until she is dispelled by a specific magical effect.
