While grappled, the target is restrained and takes 3 (1d6) damage at the start of each of its turns as it is slowly dragged towards the Pantry Root Horror."

			"Content": "Melee Attack: +5 to hit, dealing 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead or a construct, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or lose 5 (1d10) hit points at the start of each of its turns due to necrotic decay as the Pantry Root Horror's maw racially absorbs their vitality. Each time the Pantry Root Horror hits the affected target with this attack, the decay damage increases by an additional 5 (1d10). The target can take an action to end the effect with a successful DC 12 check. The condition also ends if the target receives magical healing."

The area remains in place for 1 minute and is difficult terrain. Creatures can use an action to escape by succeeding on a DC 12 Strength check."
