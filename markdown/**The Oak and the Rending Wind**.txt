# **The Oak and the Rending Wind**

The Oak and the Rending Wind Katas take their inspiration from the classic fable of The Oak and the Reed, a tale illustrating two contrasting forms of resilience. In the story, the mighty oak stands tall and unyielding against the wind, confident in its strength, while the reed bends and sways, adapting to the force of the storm. When a great tempest arises, the oak, rigid and unmoving, is ultimately uprooted and destroyed, whereas the reed, though fragile in appearance, survives by yielding to the wind. This fable serves as a metaphor for strength and flexibility in martial arts—understanding when to stand firm and when to flow with external forces.

The first kata, Kōboku (枯木, “Enduring Oak”), represents the unyielding strength and immovability of the oak. Its structure emphasizes rooted stances, solid structure, and reinforced positioning, mirroring the tree’s defiance against external forces. The sequence transitions through Kempo, Shuri Sanchin, Tensho, and Naha Sanchin, reinforcing the idea of unwavering presence and control. Each technique reinforces resilience, absorbing impact, and maintaining an unshakable stance, embodying the philosophy that true strength is not merely force, but the ability to withstand and endure.

The second kata, Fūretsu (風裂, “Rending Wind”), represents the unstoppable force that seeks to shatter stability, much like the storm that ultimately breaks the oak. Unlike Kōboku, which is built on holding firm, Fūretsu is about disruption, breaking structure, and unbalancing opponents. It employs techniques that attack from above, below, left, and right, challenging the rigid defenses of Kōboku. Every strike, sweep, and redirection in this kata mimics the relentless nature of wind—unpredictable, overwhelming, and ever-moving. In contrast to the oak’s immobility, Fūretsu teaches that mastery lies in adaptability, in knowing how to dismantle strength through fluidity and precision.

Together, these two katas form the Rengoku (連獄) kata series, The Oak and the Rending Wind Katas, a study in opposing yet complementary principles. Kōboku teaches the martial artist how to stand firm, absorb force, and maintain stability, while Fūretsu teaches how to break through rigidity, adapt to overwhelming force, and remain in motion. Within both katas, the reed is ever-present—manifesting in the circular, flowing transitions that exist within their structures. The lesson of these katas is not simply choosing between strength or adaptability, but understanding when to be the oak and when to be the reed, embracing the philosophy that true mastery lies in knowing how to blend both.

Each kata can be performed in two distinct ways, depending on whether it is practiced in isolation or as part of a structured progression. When performed individually, both Kōboku and Fūretsu follow a four-directional embusen, reinforcing the idea of being tested from all angles. This approach emphasizes adaptability, requiring the practitioner to maintain stability or disrupt balance while reacting to attacks from multiple directions. However, when practiced together in sequence, as part of the Rengoku format, the embusen straightens, aligning into a forward-moving structure. In this format, Kōboku moves forward, standing firm against progressive challenges, while Fūretsu follows, moving backward as it dismantles and disrupts the previous form’s stability. This alignment represents a direct contest between resilience and destruction, sharpening both the defensive and offensive applications of the katas. The shifting embusen between solo and paired practice highlights the deeper lesson within these forms—knowing when to resist from all sides and when to engage in a direct confrontation of opposing forces.

One of the key purposes of The Oak and the Rending Wind Katas is to bridge the gap between Kempo’s fluid, adaptable forms and the rigid structure of Sanchin, offering a clear progression for practitioners moving from one to the other. Many martial artists trained in Kempo struggle with the transition to Sanchin due to its emphasis on dynamic tension, rooted stances, and controlled breathing, which contrasts sharply with Kempo’s explosive, mobile techniques. To address this, the katas are built in four distinct sequences, each progressively refining movement from adaptable Kempo flow toward the immovable structure of Sanchin. The first sequence emphasizes Kempo-style techniques, where circular movements and

rapid redirections are still present, allowing for fluid expression and reactionary adaptation. The second sequence introduces Shuri Sanchin, a softened version of the form where breath control and structural reinforcement begin to take precedence, but the movement remains snappy and mobile. The third sequence shifts into Tensho, where circular energy is retained but breath control and structural awareness become more dominant, focusing on the ability to redirect, absorb, and generate power through controlled motion. Finally, the last sequence settles into Naha Sanchin, fully embracing the principles of dynamic tension, rooted stances, and controlled power output, completing the transition from flexible adaptation to unshakable stability. Through this structured approach, the katas serve as a stepping stone, gradually refining a martial artist’s movement until they can seamlessly integrate the hardness of Sanchin without sacrificing the adaptability of Kempo.

### Part 1: Kempo – Circular Blocks Against Linear Attacks, Linear Strikes Against Circular Attacks

This sequence builds upon fundamental Kempo forms, introducing methods for countering various attack types. It emphasizes that circular attacks are best intercepted with linear counters, while linear attacks are best redirected using circular blocks. This phase continues from beginner-level Kempo, bridging its fluid movements with the structured power of more advanced kata.

Techniques emphasize hip-driven power (腰の力, *koshi no chikara*), ensuring efficient force generation from the core. Utilizing relaxation (抜く, *nuku*) creates snap, allowing techniques to remain fast and adaptable until the moment of impact, where full focus (極め, *kime*) ensures decisive force. Movements teach practitioners to flow between soft and hard execution, ensuring maximum efficiency in both redirection and striking.

Unlike **Fūretsu’s flowing, destabilizing attacks**, Kōboku establishes **rooted positioning and controlled force application**. Every movement in this section is structured to **counteract the 

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

breaking momentum of Fūretsu**, ensuring that:

- **Fūretsu’s rising attacks are neutralized with downward redirection.**
- **Its lateral and rotational strikes are met with structural reinforcement.**
- **Where Fūretsu seeks to disrupt balance, Kōboku reinforces stability.**

#### Part 1: Movement Breakdown

1. **Step Forward into Sanchin-dachi (三戦立ち, Three Battles Stance)**
   - Move the **right foot forward**, maintaining a **rooted stance** to counter Fūretsu’s backward-stepping evasion.
   - **Counters:**
     - While Fūretsu steps **backward** into mobility, Kōboku **steps forward into a fortified stance**, preventing the opponent from resetting their structure.
     - This forward engagement ensures **Kōboku stays inside the opponent’s movement range** rather than allowing space for redirections.
   - **Breathing:**
     - **Controlled exhale (Kime, 極め)** ensures force transfer without loss of structure.


2. **Double Block (Nagashi Morote Uke, 流し諸手受け) – Deflecting Fūretsu’s Rising Palm Heel Strike**
   - **Perform a simultaneous circular double block ("Wax-On, Wax-Off" motion) to the left.**
   - **The right hand executes an inward block (内受け, *uchi uke*)**.
   - **The left hand performs an outward block (外受け, *soto uke*)**.
   - **Counters:**
     - **Directly intercepts Fūretsu’s Age Teisho Uchi (Rising Palm Heel Strike)**, preventing upward force from unbalancing the stance.
     - Ensures Fūretsu’s lifting technique is met with **a reinforced redirection** rather than static resistance.
     - Since Fūretsu **targets the chin**, this deflection redirects it before it can establish vertical force.
   - **Breathing:**
     - **Sharp exhalation at impact (Kime, 極め)**.

3. **Simultaneous Counter – Right Uchi Uke (内受け) & Left Teisho Uchi (掌底打ち, Palm Heel Strike)**
   - **Right hand: Executes an open-hand inward block (内受け, *uchi uke*)**.
   - **Left hand: Strikes with a palm heel (掌底打ち, *teisho uchi*)** to the opponent’s chest.
   - **Counters:**
     - **Intercepts Fūretsu’s Mawashi Zuki (Hook Punch) before full extension**, disrupting rotational momentum.
     - **Prevents Fūretsu from using hip rotation to generate full striking power**.
     - Instead of **absorbing the hook’s force**, Kōboku **drives force forward**, breaking the opponent’s ability to continue their strike.
   - **Breathing:**
     - **Short exhale upon impact**, reinforcing stability.

4. **Downward Double Block (Otoshi Nagashi Uke, 落とし流し受け) – Cutting Off Fūretsu’s Hammerfist**
   - **Perform the same "Wax-On, Wax-Off" motion, but downward.**
   - **Right hand performs a downward inward block (内下段払い, *uchi gedan barai*)**.
   - **Left hand performs a downward outward block (外下段払い, *soto gedan barai*)**.
   - **Counters:**
     - **Directly intercepts Fūretsu’s Otoshi Tettsui (Descending Hammerfist)** before it can drive downward force into the ribs or thighs.
     - **Prevents Fūretsu from breaking stance control**, keeping Kōboku’s posture stable.
     - Since Fūretsu **relies on downward hammering force**, this redirection diffuses the impact before it lands.
   - **Breathing:**
     - **Short, controlled exhale at impact (Kime, 極め)**.

The second sequence mirrors the first, reinforcing bilateral coordination by executing the techniques on the opposite side. This time, the movement begins with the left foot stepping forward into Sanchin-dachi (三戦立ち), ensuring that the body develops equal structural integrity, power transfer, and reaction timing on both sides. By repeating the same principles in reverse orientation, practitioners refine balanced execution, adaptability, and seamless transition between dominant and non-dominant stances.

#### Key Principles:

- **Redirection Over Collision** → Blocks follow a circular path, deflecting force rather than absorbing it.
- **Simultaneous Offense & Defense** → The block and strike land together, emphasizing economy of motion.
- **Hip Integration for Power** → The snap-back (腰の捻り, *koshi no hineri*) ensures maximum power efficiency.
- **Quick Exhalation at Impact** → Each technique finishes with **Kime (極め), creating a moment of total focus and contraction**.

### Part 2: Shuri Sanchin – Structural Strength and Precision

This sequence transitions from the fluid adaptability of Kempo to the structured precision of Shuri Sanchin. While movement remains dynamic, the emphasis shifts toward stability, **breath control**, and refined mechanics. The key lesson here is balancing **softness and structure**, reinforcing stance integrity while maintaining snap and fluidity.

Unlike the tension-driven **Naha Sanchin**, Shuri Sanchin allows **mobility**, utilizing **elbow positioning (腕を中心に寄る, *ude o chūshin ni yoru*) to create inward compression** for compact strength. **This phase introduces controlled breathing (Ibuki, 息吹), focusing on soft Ibuki (柔らかい息吹, *yawarakai ibuki*) for continuous breath regulation.**

Unlike **Fūretsu’s flowing deflections and disruptions**, **Kōboku reinforces rooted structure, direct pressure, and controlled breath engagement.** While **Fūretsu prioritizes constant contact and fluid redirections**, **Kōboku tests and reinforces stance integrity**, countering each **breaking motion** with **structural reinforcement**.

#### Part 2: Movement Breakdown

1. **Step Forward into Sanchin-dachi (三戦立ち, Three Battles Stance)**
   - Move the **right foot forward**, maintaining a **rooted stance** to resist Fūretsu’s continuous motion.
   - **Counters:**
     - While Fūretsu initiates **simultaneous ridge hand strikes**, Kōboku **enters into a stabilized Sanchin-dachi**, ensuring the stance does not collapse from lateral pressure.
     - **Sanchin structure absorbs sudden attacks to the neck by reinforcing core tension.**
   - **Breathing:**
     - **Soft Ibuki (柔らかい息吹, Yawarakai Ibuki)** ensures control and prevents overreaction.

2. **Simultaneous Double Outward Palm Blocks (Morote Yoko Uke, 諸手横受け) – Redirecting Fūretsu’s Ridge Hand Strikes**
   - **Both hands execute outward side blocks (横受け, *yoko uke*)** simultaneously.
   - **Elbows angle inward** to generate compact power.
   - **Counters:**
     - **Absorbs Fūretsu’s Haito Uchi (Ridge Hand Strikes) by reinforcing inward compression.**
     - Since Fūretsu **maintains contact**, Kōboku’s outward palm blocks **redirect force without breaking structure**.
   - **Breathing:**
     - **Soft Ibuki**, exhaling naturally to sustain fluidity without stiffness.

3. **Simultaneous Double Nukite (両貫手, Ryō Nukite) to the Collarbone – Disrupting Fūretsu’s Wrist Manipulation**
   - **Both hands execute spearhand strikes (貫手, *nukite*)** simultaneously, aiming at **each side of the opponent’s collarbones**.
   - **Counters:**
     - **Overwhelms Fūretsu’s Kote Kaeshi (Wrist Rotation Deflection) by forcing the opponent to react defensively.**
     - **Interrupts Fūretsu’s contact-based flow**, making it harder for them to continue their sequence.
   - **Breathing:**
     - **Soft Ibuki exhale**, ensuring power without overextending the structure.

4. **Simultaneous Double Shuto Kake Uke (両手刀掛け受け, Ryō Shuto Kake Uke) – Neutralizing Fūretsu’s Palm Press**
   - **Both hands execute hooking knife-hand blocks (手刀掛け受け, *shuto kake uke*) simultaneously.**
   - **Counters:**
     - **Intercepts Fūretsu’s Double Teisho Osae (Palm-Heel Press) from both sides**, preventing full force application.
     - **Ensures that Kōboku does not lose stability against forward-driving pressure.**
   - **Breathing:**
     - **Soft Ibuki exhalation**, maintaining **relaxed but controlled breathing**.

#### Key Principles:
- **Inward Elbows for Strength** → Drawing **elbows inward during Yoko Uke** creates **dynamic power and compact defense**.
- **Targeted Stability** → **The Nukite strike remains firm**, using **vertical engagement** rather than excessive movement.
- **Seamless Flow** → **The Shuto Kake Uke transition** allows for continuous **defense and offensive readiness**.
- **Soft Ibuki for Controlled Power** → Breathing remains **natural and flowing**, preventing unnecessary tension and ensuring **proper oxygenation during movement**.

### **Part 2: Counteracting Movement Through Physical Connection**

Fūretsu emphasizes **constant contact**, ensuring control over the opponent’s structure while seamlessly flowing between offense and redirection. **Deflections and strikes remain connected**, using smooth **redirections rather than rigid blocks** to break the opponent’s balance.

#### **Movement Breakdown**

1. **Simultaneous Haito Uchi (背刀打ち, Ridge Hand Strikes) to the Neck**
   - **Both hands execute simultaneous ridge hand strikes** to the sides of the opponent’s neck.
   - Strikes **land at the carotid area**, forcing a reaction and breaking their structure.
   - The **wrists maintain contact**, ensuring the next motion flows seamlessly.
   - **Breathing:** Short, sharp exhale upon impact, reinforcing fluid kime.

2. **Double-Handed Deflection with Rotating Wrists (Kote Kaeshi, 小手返し)**
   - As the opponent reacts, **rotate both wrists inward simultaneously** so that:\n
     - **Fingers point downward.**
     - **Palms face outward.**
   - This motion **redirects the opponent’s strike**, breaking their offense without absorbing force.
   - **Maintain light contact**, allowing control without stiffness.
   - **Breathing:** **Inhale softly** during the deflection to prepare for the counter.

3. **Double Teisho Osae (掌底押え, Dual Palm-Heel Press)**
   - With hands still in contact, **push forward with both palms**, driving into the opponent’s **chest or shoulders**.
   - The motion **guides forcefully but fluidly**, using forward momentum to **disrupt balance**.
   - **Do not shove**—pressure is applied with **steady control** rather than brute force.
   - **Breathing:** **Exhale smoothly** during the push, ensuring continuity of movement.

#### **Key Principles**
- **Continuous Contact** → The hands and wrists stay **connected**, controlling the opponent’s movement.\n
- **Soft Ibuki Breathing (柔らかい息吹)** → A **gentle inhale with the deflection**, a **smooth exhale with the push**, avoiding tension buildup.\n
- **Redirection Over Resistance** → The deflection **guides the attack aside**, setting up the counter without clashing.\n
- **Guided Pressure** → The **palms press with controlled force**, ensuring balance disruption without overextension.

### Part 1: Kempo – Circular Blocks Against Linear Attacks, Linear Strikes Against Circular Attacks

This sequence builds upon fundamental Kempo forms, introducing methods for countering various attack types. It emphasizes that circular attacks are best intercepted with linear counters, while linear attacks are best redirected using circular blocks. This phase continues from beginner-level Kempo, bridging its fluid movements with the structured power of more advanced kata.

Techniques emphasize hip-driven power (腰の力, *koshi no chikara*), ensuring efficient force generation from the core. Utilizing relaxation (抜く, *nuku*) creates snap, allowing techniques to remain fast and adaptable until the moment of impact, where full focus (極め, *kime*) ensures decisive force. Movements teach practitioners to flow between soft and hard execution, ensuring maximum efficiency in both redirection and striking.

#### Part 1: Movement Breakdown

1. **Step Forward into Sanchin-dachi (三戦立ち, Three Battles Stance)**
   - Move the right foot forward, maintaining a solid yet flexible base.
   - Keep the knees slightly engaged to allow for stability and power transfer.
   - **Breathing:**
     - **No Ibuki.** This phase uses quick exhalation and contraction **(Kime, 極め)** at the moment of impact.

2. **Double-Hand Block to the Left (Morote Uke, 諸手受け) – "Wax-On, Wax-Off"**
   - Right hand executes an inward block (内受け, *uchi uke*).
   - Left hand performs an outward block (外受け, *soto uke*).
   - This motion redirects force smoothly, utilizing a circular deflection rather than brute force.
   - **Breathing:**
     - **No Ibuki.** Quick exhalation at impact **(Kime, 極め)**.

3. **Simultaneous Counter – Right Uchi Uke (内受け) & Left Teisho Uchi (掌底打ち, Palm Heel Strike)**
   - Right hand: Executes an open-hand inward block (内受け, *uchi uke*).
   - Left hand: Strikes with a palm heel (掌底打ち, *teisho uchi*) to the opponent’s chest.
   - Both movements land simultaneously, coordinated with a hip snap-back (腰の捻り, *koshi no hineri*) for explosive power.
   - **Breathing:**
     - **Quick exhalation upon impact (Kime, 極め)**, ensuring **maximum force with minimal tension buildup**.

4. **Downward "Wax-On, Wax-Off" Double Block to the Left**
   - Perform a double downward block (下段払い, *gedan barai*) using the same circular redirection as before.
   - Left hand blocks inward, right hand blocks outward in a downward sweeping motion.
   - Maintain hip engagement to ensure the technique is connected to the whole body.
   - **Breathing:**
     - **Quick exhalation at impact (Kime, 極め)**.

The second sequence mirrors the first, reinforcing bilateral coordination by executing the techniques on the opposite side. This time, the movement begins with the left foot stepping forward into Sanchin-dachi (三戦立ち), ensuring that the body develops equal structural integrity, power transfer, and reaction timing on both sides. By repeating the same principles in reverse orientation, practitioners refine balanced execution, adaptability, and seamless transition between dominant and non-dominant stances.

#### Key Principles:

- **Redirection Over Collision** → Blocks follow a circular path, deflecting force rather than absorbing it.
- **Simultaneous Offense & Defense** → The block and strike land together, emphasizing economy of motion.
- **Hip Integration for Power** → The snap-back (腰の捻り, *koshi no hineri*) ensures maximum power efficiency.
- **Quick Exhalation at Impact** → Each technique finishes with **Kime (極め), creating a moment of total focus and contraction**.

### **Flowing Exercise: The Infinite Counter between Kōboku and Fūretsu**

The interaction between **Kōboku and Fūretsu** can be practiced as a **continuous two-person drill**, where each sequence seamlessly transitions into the countering sequence of the opposing kata. One practitioner begins with **Kōboku**, reinforcing structure and stability, while the other responds with **Fūretsu**, using fluid disruptions to break through. Once the **first exchange is completed**, the roles immediately reverse—**the practitioner who performed Fūretsu now initiates their full sequence, while their partner responds with Kōboku’s counter-structure**. This cycle repeats indefinitely, creating a **flowing exercise that alternates between stability and disruption**.

This practice refines **timing, adaptability, and structural integrity**, forcing both practitioners to develop a **deeper understanding of when to reinforce and when to break structure**. Unlike static drills, this format mirrors **real combat dynamics**, where a martial artist must decide when to stand firm and when to flow with external force. The exercise can be slowed down to refine mechanics or accelerated to develop reactive efficiency, making it a valuable method for internalizing both katas’ principles. In this way, **Kōboku and Fūretsu are not just opposing forces—they become two halves of a continuous cycle, each shaping the other in an endless exchange of power and adaptability**.

### **Flowing Exercise: Infinite Contact and Redirection in Part 2**

Part 2 of **Kōboku and Fūretsu** can be practiced as a **sticky-hands-style drill**, where both practitioners remain in continuous contact, seamlessly transitioning between offense and defense. Kōboku applies **structured resistance and precise counters**, while Fūretsu responds with **constant redirection and flow**, creating a **dynamic exchange of force, structure, and adaptability**. Instead of breaking apart after each engagement, the sequence cycles infinitely—one practitioner executes **Fūretsu’s deflections and manipulations**, while their partner responds with **Kōboku’s reinforced counter-structures**. Once the full sequence is completed, roles reverse, allowing for **fluid development of timing, tactile sensitivity, and adaptive control**.

This exercise teaches **how to maintain contact, predict movements, and refine counterapplication through feel rather than reaction speed alone**. Like traditional **sticky-hands (Chi Sao) or Kakie drills**, it conditions practitioners to respond **instinctively to shifting pressure, ensuring their structure remains intact even under continuous engagement**. Over time, this develops a **deep awareness of weight distribution, stance integrity, and controlled redirection**—key elements that bridge the philosophies of both katas.
