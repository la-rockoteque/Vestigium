___  

This document is the sole property of the **Agency for Surveillance, Tracking, and Regulation of Anomalous Landscapes (A.S.T.R.A.L.)** and is classified under **Protocol X-27**. Unauthorized access, duplication, or distribution is a direct violation of the **Anomalous Contingency Act (A.C.A. §13-97)** and will be met with immediate countermeasures, up to and including **forced administrative reassignment** (which, in certain cases, may involve existing in a different timeline).  

By opening this document, you acknowledge:  
- **You have the necessary clearance level** to access restricted anomaly intelligence.  
- **You have not, at any point, been replaced by an identical anomaly impersonation** (if unsure, consult **Verification Form 92-A**).  
- **You are subject to continuous monitoring** under Section 12 of the Astral Compliance Directive.  
- **Any unauthorized disclosure will trigger Protocol X**, authorizing full intervention by **Containment & Erasure Taskforce Omega** (Note: The **previous** Containment & Erasure Taskforce Omega was erased under Protocol X. This is the **new** Taskforce Omega. Try not to ask what happened).  
- **Dissemination of classified content will result in memory redaction procedures**, as outlined in **Directive 46-C**, or, if memory redaction is not feasible, assignment to the **Department of Unanswered Inquiries** (success rate: inconclusive).  

If you are not the intended recipient:  
1. **Cease all interaction immediately.**  
2. **Report this breach to A.S.T.R.A.L. Oversight Bureau (O.B.)** via secure terminal **[O.B.//DIRECT-LINK-SEC/347-99]**.  
3. **Wait for retrieval personnel to arrive.** This may take **minutes, weeks, or retroactively already have happened**.  

**Failure to comply will result in automatic escalation to Level-4 Contingency Response, which involves (but is not limited to):**  
- **A 48-hour debriefing inside an undisclosed location** (which you will **never** be able to find again).  
- **A mandatory seminar on "The Importance of Forgetting"** (attendance is compulsory; comprehension is optional).  
- **Being reassigned as an anomaly observer** (or, if deemed necessary, as an anomaly).

# **THE OTHER ISLANDS OF THE FLOATING REALMS**  
## **A SITUATIONAL BRIEFING**  
### *Filed under: Astral Geographic Contingency Report #77-B*  
**For Internal Use Only – Do Not Archive, Unless Required, Or Already Archived**  

## **Overview**  

Concord City is the **largest and most influential** entity in the Floating Realms, but **not the only one**. Numerous **other islands drift through the skies**, each with its **own government, economy, and level of anomaly mismanagement**.  

These islands exist in **a delicate balance of trade, diplomacy, and occasional existential instability**. While some maintain **formal relationships with Concord City**, others operate under **questionable legality, anomalous sovereignty, or complete disregard for observable reality**.  

The following is a **comprehensive (subject to revision and/or denial) classification** of notable floating islands, their **political structures**, their **economic significance**, and **how much of a problem they are expected to become in the next five cycles** (note: **five cycles remain undefined as of last revision**).  

## **How These Islands Affect Concord City**  
- **Trade Relations:** Concord City is **the economic powerhouse**, but **it relies on imports** from these islands for **resources, knowledge, military forces, and illicit goods**.  
- **Political Tensions:** Each island has **its own policies on anomalies**, and **not all align with Concord City's corporate-driven model**. Conflicts **over trade, governance, and anomaly containment** are common.  
- **Factions & Influence:** These islands house **independent factions** that can either **support or oppose the players**, depending on their goals.  

### **Conclusion**  
The other islands exist as **independent political and economic entities**, but Concord City remains **the largest and most unstable hub of paranormal activity**. As the campaign progresses, these islands **may become allies, battlegrounds, or even refuge**, depending on how the players interact with them.

# 🌆 Sablemarch – The Rogue Port
> *"Trade is free, but so is treachery."*

## 📌 Overview
Sablemarch is the **underworld’s primary smuggling hub**, an industrial playground where rogue corporations, private security firms, and black-market traders operate freely. The island thrives on **unregulated commerce**, including **illicit anomaly dealings, shipbuilding contracts, and mercenary services**. Unlike Concord City, Sablemarch has **no centralized authority**, making it both a haven and a dangerous place for anyone willing to do business beyond the law.

## 🌍 Geography & Structure
- A **chaotic port city**, built on layers of **rusted docks, salvaged ships, and labyrinthine trade zones**.  
- **No defined districts**—the city expands and contracts as new factions carve out territory.

## 📌 Overview  
Dreadmere is a **vast, burning metropolis** at the base of the Ashen Spiral, home to the **Dren**, an ancient race of smoke-breathing beings whose technology is **as alien as it is advanced**. The city is **a furnace of innovation and endurance**, its towers of **blackened stone and molten veins** standing unshaken by time. To the unprepared, **Dreadmere is uninhabitable**—its streets waver in a mirage of heat, its air thick with **sulfur, metallic dust, and curling smoke**.  

Despite its hostile environment, Dreadmere is **one of the most advanced civilizations in existence**. The Dren's technology is **not digital, nor mechanical—it is something older, something woven into the fabric of existence itself**. They have no screens, no data banks, no circuitry—yet their creations **eclipse mortal innovation** in efficiency, permanence, and resilience.  

Dreadmere is **the only sanctioned gateway into the Spiral**, and those who seek its depths **must first prove they can withstand the city's trials**. The Dren allow outsiders, but only those **willing to endure**.

## ⚔️ Major Factions

## 📝 Key Observations from A.S.T.R.A.L.

We have studied their technology for decades, and we are no closer to understanding its function. It does not corrode. It does not degrade. It does not require power. It simply is."*

## 📝 Key Observations from A.S.T.R.A.L.

## **Key Observations from A.S.T.R.A.L.'s Department of Geographic Anomalies & Diplomatic Failures**  

- **Varnhallow** produces **industrial output at a staggering rate**, but it remains unclear **how their labor force endures such conditions** (*see: Incident Report VNH-74, in which an entire factory operated for three days without workers*).  
- **Erelis** houses **the highest concentration of scholars, researchers, and people who say “it’s just a theory” before vanishing under mysterious circumstances**.  
- **Sablemarch** is technically a **trade hub**, though most of its **exports are smuggled, and most of its imports are stolen**.  
- **Vexholm** believes **anomalies should be weaponized**, and **if that statement does not immediately concern you, you have not read enough A.S.T.R.A.L. declassified documents**.  
- **Lysoria** remains **the least documented island**, due to an unusual phenomenon where **anyone attempting to write a detailed report about it instead finds themselves writing poetry about clouds**.  

## **Current Risks & Recommendations**  

- **Potential diplomatic incidents: HIGH** *(Probability of at least one island declaring hostility towards Concord City: 87%)*  
- **Unregulated anomaly presence: EXTREME** *(Sablemarch alone has more **illegal anomaly trafficking** than A.S.T.R.A.L. has tracking personnel)*  
- **Probability of one or more islands vanishing without explanation: UNCERTAIN** *(Last cycle, Erelis disappeared for six months. They insist they were “always there.” We are currently pretending to believe them.)*  
- **Likelihood of Vexholm testing an anomalous weapon on a nearby island: GUARANTEED** *(The only uncertainty is which island will be the unlucky recipient.)*  

**Final Recommendation:** Continue **monitoring**, establish **containment protocols where possible**, and **absolutely do not accept invitations to "anomaly-enhanced warfare demonstrations" from Vexholm**.
