___  

This document is the sole property of **A.S.T.R.A.L.** and is classified under **Operational Directive 17-XR**. Unauthorized access, duplication, or dissemination violates the **Containment & Compliance Mandate (C.C.M. §21-67)** and will trigger immediate countermeasures.  

By accessing this file, you acknowledge:  
- You have **clearance** to review **regulated gameplay protocols**.  
- **Monitoring is active** under **Mandate 52-A**.  
- **Unauthorized modifications** will activate **Enforcement Directive Theta**.  
- Disclosing classified rule changes invokes **memory revision measures** under **Directive 93-P**.  

This document provides **standardized rule adjustments** for **anomalous engagements**. Rule modifications remain under **Strategic Regulation Bureau (S.R.B.)** review.  

If you are not the intended recipient, cease interaction and report to **Compliance Oversight Bureau (C.O.B.)** via secure terminal [C.O.B.//DIRECT-LINK-SEC/217-45]. Noncompliance escalates to **Containment Protocol Omega-4**.

### **Directive 7-A – Modular Rule Compliance**  
**Summary:** Due to unpredictable anomalies, all engagements must follow the **Adaptive Regulatory Model (A.R.M.)** to ensure rulings remain **responsive and balanced**.  

- **ETV (Engagement Threshold Variance):** Game Authorities (G.A.) may modify rules to adapt to field conditions.  
- **RRD (Rule Reconciliation Directive):** Conflicts must be resolved using the **Internal Arbitration Matrix**.  
- **NSM (Narrative Stability Measures):** Excessive mechanical deviations risk **containment breaches**.  

All personnel must **review updated strategies** before regulated gameplay. **Unauthorized improvisation is prohibited (A.C.C. §12-98).**

# **📌 Regions of Concord City**
> *"The city itself is your battlefield. Learn it, and you will survive."*

In *Vestigium*, the traditional wilderness-based terrain types of *Dungeons & Dragons* are **obsolete**. Instead, Concord City is a vast, brutalist sprawl filled with **decaying industrial zones, corporate fortresses, and unpredictable anomalies**.

Each **region** introduces unique **hazards, movement challenges, and encounters**, ensuring that terrain itself **is as much a threat as the enemies.**

---

## *📌 Region Format**
Each **region** provides:
- **📌 Hazards** – Environmental dangers that make travel risky.
- **📌 Navigation Challenges** – Obstacles that impact movement.
- **📌 Encounters** – The types of adversaries that lurk here.
- **📌 Dynamic Elements** – How the environment **changes over time**.
- **📌 DM Tips** – Advice on using the region to enhance gameplay.

---

## **🏭 Industrial Districts**
> *"Choking smog, automated factories, and unstable structures define the industrial wastelands of Concord City."*

### **📌 Hazards**
- **Collapsing scaffolding** – Heavy equipment and high catwalks **break under stress**.
- **Toxic spills** – Pools of corrosive chemicals **deal acid damage on contact**.
- **Power surges** – **Live wires discharge**, shocking creatures within **5 feet**.
- **Automated turrets** – Factory defenses **lock onto movement**.

### **📌 Navigation Challenges**
- **Conveyor belts move creatures 10 ft per round.**
- **Smoke & steam cause heavily obscured areas.**
- **Locked factory doors require hacking or brute force.**

### **📌 Encounters**
- **A.S.T.R.A.L. Clean-Up Crews** investigating spills.
- **Industrial Strikers** blocking corporate-owned roads.
- **Black-market dealers** trading in illegal weapons.

### **📌 Dynamic Elements**
- **Corporate Rollout** – Automated drones **increase security every hour.**
- **System Malfunction** – Machinery **activates randomly**, creating hazards.

### **📌 DM Tips**
- Introduce **hazards gradually**, allowing players to adapt.
- Use **power surges and robotic defenses** as soft environmental dangers.
- Allow **hacking, sabotage, or creative movement solutions**.

📌 **Example Encounter Idea:**  
*As the players sneak through an abandoned factory, a sudden power surge ignites a nearby gas pipe, causing a **chain reaction of explosions** that forces them to react quickly or risk being buried under falling debris.*  

---

## **🏙️ High-Rise Megastructures**
> *"A city within a city. Some floors haven't seen sunlight in decades."*

### **📌 Hazards**
- **Unstable catwalks** – Require **Dexterity saves** to cross.
- **Malfunctioning elevators** – **Drop suddenly**, dealing falling damage.
- **Power outages** – Cause **total darkness**.

### **📌 Navigation Challenges**
- **Stairs are jammed or collapsed**, forcing **vertical movement**.
- **Windows provide access routes but require scaling.**
- **Hallways are identical**, making navigation difficult.

### **📌 Encounters**
- **Squatter factions** defending their territory.
- **Black-market brokers** running cybernetic smuggling rings.

  - **Hackers & spellcasters can manipulate certain hazards.**  

## **📌 How This Changes Gameplay**
