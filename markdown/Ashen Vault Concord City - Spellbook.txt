Many of these arcane functions were **not invented**, but rather discovered—echoes of incantations whispered by forces indifferent to chronology or physics. While some appear mimetic to common schools of magic, others defy classification, language, or geometry.

Any known anomalies, scaling instabilities, or arcane side effects are recorded where available. Information gaps are not omissions—they are warnings.

---

### ⚠ OPERATIONAL NOTICE  

By accessing this archive, the caster consents to the following:  
- You understand that **arcane pattern irregularities** may produce unstable results in field application.  
- You are **legally bound to report** any unintended ontological distortions, bodily mutations, or post-cast memory displacement to Division 7.  
- You accept that **prolonged exposure to Unhinged-class spells** may compromise subjective identity permanence.

If at any point you experience hallucinated timelines, recursive dreams, or the appearance of non-euclidean glyphs in peripheral vision, cease use and submit Form 19-B through a secured thaumacrypt channel.

### SPELL DESIGNATIONS

- **Cantrip-Level Manifestations** – Minor anomaly echoes with ritual-scale implications.  
- **Spellforms Level 1–4** – Low to moderate stability; authorized for field agents and audited freelancers.  
- **Pacted Invocations** – Bloodbound or geased; use requires registered pact signature on file.  
- **Unhinged-Class** – Origin unknown; typically tethered to cognitive or metaphysical strain.  
- **Experimental Constructs** – Includes recovered formulas from redacted laboratories or abandoned vaults.  
- **Terrain-Bound Magic** – Spellforms that manifest only under specific material, architectural, or anomalous environmental conditions.

### ✴ A.S.T.R.A.L. FIELD GUIDANCE FOR ANOMALOUS SPELL USAGE  

> Do not trust a spell simply because it behaves.  
> Magic is not a science. It is not a language. It is not even a force.  
> It is a **reaction**—to presence, intention, location, and memory.  

The following are live field protocols regarding Vestigium-class spellforms:

1. **ALL spells should be tested under controlled conditions** before battlefield use.  
2. **DO NOT attempt to ‘correct’ unstable spells** using traditional counterspell logic. Some are recursive. Some are sentient.  
3. **IF you hear your name whispered mid-cast**, do not finish the incantation. Report the experience.  
4. **TAGS such as UNSTABLE, BLOOD PACT, or MISPELLED** are not metaphors.  
5. **DO NOT share spellforms with untrained casters**, even if they appear benign. Several spells listed as "minor illusions" have previously triggered mass disappearances.  

---

### IMPORTANT FINAL NOTE

Each spell in this document has been **witnessed, felt, and survived** by at least one A.S.T.R.A.L. agent. Some spells *bite back.* Some cast themselves. A few... remain unsolvable.

You are not just reading a spellbook. You are participating in a containment breach one word at a time.

Handle each page like it's breathing.

#### A.S.T.R.A.L. Intrusion Barrier
*6th-level Abjuration*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self (30-foot radius)
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a lead-etched data chip)

This powerful anti-surveillance veil renders a zone invisible to scrying, digital observation, and magical surveillance.
 
- Spells like Surveillance Override, Corporate Remote View, and A.S.T.R.A.L. Drone Recon automatically fail to observe inside the area.
- Cameras, sensors, and paranormal optics show false static or pre-recorded footage instead of real-time activity.
- The field extends into other planes, blocking extraplanar surveillance.

- At 7th level, the field also masks teleportation signatures, preventing tracking.
- At 8th level, the spell lingers for 1 hour even after concentration ends.

---

#### A.S.T.R.A.L. Protocol Override
*7th-level Abjuration*
*Wizard, Cleric*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 reaction
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (an encoded directive)

When a creature within 60 feet casts a spell, you interrupt and delay its activation. The targeted spell has no immediate effect. Instead, roll 1d4. After that many rounds have passed (at the beginning of your turn), the delayed spell automatically fails, expending its original caster’s spell slot or resources without taking effect.

During the delay, the original caster is aware the spell is stalled but cannot cancel or change the delayed spell, nor recover the spell slot or resources used. Until the spell fails, it counts as “being cast,” preventing the caster from concentrating on another spell if it required concentration. You may only have one spell delayed by A.S.T.R.A.L. Protocol Override active at a time. If you cast this spell again before the previous delayed spell fails, the original delayed spell immediately resolves as normal (taking effect instantly) instead of failing.

---

#### A.S.T.R.A.L. Protocol: Finality
*8th-level Abjuration*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet (20-foot-radius sphere)
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (an encrypted containment directive)

You invoke A.S.T.R.A.L.’s highest authority, temporarily imposing absolute corporate law upon reality.
 
- Creatures within the area must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they are rendered "non-actors" in reality and can take no hostile actions for the duration.
- Magical and anomalous effects cease functioning in the area, including spells, supernatural abilities, and reality distortions.
- Creatures, objects, and spells summoned by external forces are forcibly ejected.

**Blood Pact:** True Name Etching

---

#### A.S.T.R.A.L. Recall
*4th-level Conjuration*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (an encrypted terminal key)

A recently deceased body (within the last minute) is teleported to the nearest emergency facility or

 corporate medical center for immediate resuscitation. The creature returns to life at half HP after 1d6 rounds.

---

#### A.S.T.R.A.L. Redaction
*5th-level Transmutation*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: 10 minutes
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Duration:** :: Permanent 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a classified document burned to ash)

You purge all traces of a target from bureaucratic and digital records, making it appear as though they never existed.
 
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
- All legal, corporate, and governmental archives remove mentions of the target.
- Anyone attempting to recall or reference the target must make a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw, or they recall only vague, contradictory memories.
- If the target is alive, they are now considered a "non-entity"—unable to be tracked, processed, or employed legally.

**Blood Pact:** Offering of Self

---

#### Alerrim's Solitude
*7th-level Illusion*
*Warlock, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 ft
**Duration:** :: nan 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Material (a small wax candle)

You overwhelm the senses of up to six creatures within range with a hallucinated scent so vivid and strange that it threatens their grip on reality. The scent can be chosen by you upon casting and changes the spell’s effect. You may also choose whether the scent feels directional or all-consuming. Affected creatures must make a Constitution saving throw or suffer the selected effect.

At the end of each of their turns, affected creatures must repeat the saving throw. On two failed saves, the target becomes Stunned until the end of their next turn as the olfactory hallucination overwhelms their nervous system.

Choose one scent effect upon casting:

Rot and Filth: Targets that fail their save are Poisoned and suffer disadvantage on saving throws against charm and fear effects for the duration .

Sweet Perfume: Targets must succeed on a Wisdom save or be Charmed by you until the end of that turn.

Burnt Ozone: On a failed save, targets cannot take reactions until the start of their next turn and The creature has disadvantage on Perception and Insight checks.

You may use a bonus action on your turn to change the scent’s directionality (e.g., from everywhere to a specific direction).

The illusion lingers for 1 minute, and affected creatures must repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns. On a success, the effect ends for them.

Condition Synergy: If a target is already Frightened, Charmed, or Poisoned when affected, it has disadvantage on the initial saving throw.

Obscured Battlefield: While under the spell’s effect, affected creatures are considered heavily obscured to others—they constantly shift position in reaction to the scent, creating a surreal mirage-like presence. This effect ends if the scent illusion ends.

Additionally, while the spell is active, you may use an action to cause the scent to mimic a recognizable compound—such as smoke, fuel, or blood—potentially triggering scent-based detection systems or distracting creatures with scent-based senses.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher: Reality trembles slightly, causing a ripple that lingers unseen.

In the city of Concord, Alerrim's Solitude is outlawed, for it was once used by the cult of the Silent Maw to unmake a senator in broad daylight. Witnesses swore they saw his shadow scream before vanishing entirely.
> 
> Those who cast Alerrim's Solitude often find that they dream differently afterward. They dream of corridors that stretch into infinity, doors that lead to places older than time.*

---

#### Algorithmic Cascade
*2nd-level Evocation*
*Wizard, Sorcerer*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a broken circuit board)
**Acquisition Note:** :: A.S.T.R.A.L. does not freely issue Erasure Approvals. They are restricted to high-clearance operatives, corporate entities, or black-market brokers willing to forge the necessary documentation.

You send an unstable feedback loop into a target's mind or system, causing it to spiral into uncontrolled overload. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they take 4d6 cognitive damage and must use their reaction to make an attack against a creature of your choice within reach.
 
 On a success, they take half damage and suffer no additional effects.

 At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 per slot level above 2nd.

---

#### Amphibious Downpour
*2nd-level Conjuration*
*Druid, Wizard, Bard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 1 hour 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
You summon a localized, magical downpour of harmless frogs in a 10-foot radius area within range. The frogs immediately cover the ground, creating difficult terrain for the duration. They persistently croak in gentle harmony, producing mild distraction but no other direct harm.

When the spell ends, the frogs disperse naturally, leaving no lasting effect.

At Higher Levels:
When cast using a higher-level spell slot, the affected area expands:

Clarifications:- The frogs are non-hostile and cannot be used for damage.- The difficult terrain affects all creatures equally, allies and enemies alike.

| Spell Slot Level      | Radius of Effect   |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| 1st-level             | 10-foot radius     |
| 2nd-level             | 20-foot radius     |
| 3rd-level             | 30-foot radius     |
| 4th-level             | 40-foot radius     |
| 5th-level or higher   | 50-foot radius     |

---

#### Anomalous Afterimage
*6th-level Illusion*
*Wizard, Sorcerer, Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a cracked mirror)
**Acquisition Note:** :: Entities sensitive to time distortions may notice anomalies lingering after the spell ends.

You leave behind a temporal imprint of yourself, a flickering echo that repeats your last action every turn. This afterimage is indistinguishable from you and can be interacted with, but it cannot take new actions. If struck, it explodes into cognitive static, dealing 6d6 cognitive damage to creatures within 10 feet.

---

#### Anomalous Energy Discharge
*8th-level Evocation*
*Wizard, Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (an unstable anomaly, a crushed blueprint soaked in rainwater)
**Acquisition Note:** :: Due to its instability, use of this spell without a permit is classified as an extreme containment risk.

You trigger an uncontrolled anomaly event at a point you choose within range. All creatures in a 20-foot-radius sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 12d10 impact damage and are thrown 30 feet away. On a success, they take half damage and are not pushed.
 
 The environment is warped by this discharge, causing random gravitational shifts and distorted colors in the area for 1 minute.

---

#### Architect’s Collapse
*4th-level Transmutation*
*Cleric, Wizard, Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: 10 minutes
**Range:**        :: Touch (up to 10 feet of crafted material)
**Duration:** :: Permanent 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material 

You touch a man-made structure or crafted object, forcing it to forget how it was built—not destroyed, just unmade in an orderly fashion.
 
- Wood, stone, and metal loosen, shifting into their component parts without breaking—a smith’s forge can be unassembled cleanly, a sword can separate into its blade and hilt, and a house can collapse into its original timber and nails.
- The process is reversible—the materials remember how they were once arranged and can be restored without loss if done within 48 hours.
- A structure undone this way cannot be reassembled incorrectly—if rebuilt wrong, the materials actively resist, snapping back into their original formation.

**Anomaly Effect:**
- If misused, the materials may refuse to be reassembled, taking on forms of their own choosing.

---

#### Artificial Synchronicity
*5th-level Enchantment*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (two interlocked wires)

You bind the nervous rhythms of two willing creatures into perfect alignment, creating a temporary harmonic feedback loop between their minds and bodies. While within 10 feet of each other, the paired creatures experience the following effects:

- Combat Harmony: They gain advantage on all attack rolls made while near each other.  
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
- Cognitive Buffering: They both gain resistance to cognitive damage.  
- Synaptic Link: They can communicate telepathically for the duration.  
- Reactive Dissonance: When one takes damage, the other may use their reaction to absorb half of it, splitting the harm across both bodies.

The link feels like an artificial heartbeat humming between them—steady, precise, and faintly electric. If either target becomes unwilling or unconscious, the spell ends immediately.

---

#### Ashen Breath
*Cantrip Evocation*
*Sorcerer*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self (5-foot cone)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Material (a pinch of ash)

You exhale a puff of grayish smoke, which spreads in a small cone before quickly vanishing. Creatures in the area must make a Constitution saving throw or briefly choke on the acrid air. On a failed save, a creature cannot take reactions until the start of its next turn. This effect does not work against creatures that do not need to breathe.

---

#### Atomic Sting
*5th-level Evocation*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Up to 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a shard of irradiated glass)

You jab the target with a concentrated arc of mutagenic force—an invisible sting of unstable energy. On contact, the target suffers 6d10 radiation damage and becomes contaminated for the duration. A faint, glowing scar in the shape of a barbed sting appears where they were struck.

While contaminated:
- The target emits low-level radiation in a 5-foot radius.
- Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the target (excluding you) takes 1d6 radiation damage.
- The target takes 1d4 radiation damage at the start of each of their turns as their body fails to contain the energy.
- The contamination spreads: Any creature that ends its turn grappling or touching the target also becomes contaminated until the spell ends.

If the affected target receives any magical healing, the contamination ends for them, but the sting scar remains unless removed by Arcane Sterilization or Sigil of Restoration.

**Anomaly Effect:**
On a 15 or higher when casting: The sting pulses again one round later, forcing the target to make a new Constitution saving throw or take an additional 2d10 radiation damage.

> “The sting doesn’t kill you. It kills your presence—makes you the danger.”  
> > — Whispered at the ASTRAL quarantine labs*

---

#### Audit Strike
*3rd-level Evocation*
*Cleric, Wizard, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a blank ledger page)
**Acquisition Note:** :: Use of this spell without proper documentation may result in corporate retaliation.

A flash of judgmental energy rips through the target, determining its existential worth. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they take 6d8 impact damage. If the target is an extraplanar entity or has been altered by an anomaly, they also suffer disadvantage on their next saving throw before the end of their next turn.
 
 On a success, they take half damage.

 At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 per slot level above 3rd.

---

#### Authorized Override
*6th-level Enchantment*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a high-ranking corporate ID badge, registered to the caster)
**Acquisition Note:** :: Use of unauthorized compulsion spells within corporate zones is classified as Executive Manipulation Fraud.

You forcibly assume control of a creature’s decision-making processes. They must make an Intelligence saving throw or be compelled to follow your spoken orders as if they were their own thoughts.
 
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
- While under your influence, the target believes the commands are their own decisions.
- A creature under another compulsion effect automatically fails its save.
- The target can make another Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns to break free.

---

#### Automated Surveillance
*2nd-level Divination*
*Wizard, Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: 10 minutes
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 hour 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a broken security camera lens)

You summon an invisible, intangible drone that records everything within a 30-foot radius sphere for the duration.
 
- You may review the footage remotely at any time during the spell’s duration.
- If an anomaly or hidden entity is present, the surveillance feed experiences glitching distortions.
 
 If the spell is dispelled or the drone is discovered and disabled, all recorded data is lost.

**Blood Pact:** Oath of Blood, (Optional) Bonus: The drone becomes completely undetectable by magic.
Risk: The caster experiences phantom surveillance—for 24 hours, they feel as though they are being watched.

---

#### Binding Clause
*2nd-level Enchantment*
*Wizard, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 15 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a signed document)

With a sharp gesture, you conjure a surge of bureaucratic force—spectral office forms, glowing seals, and red ink ribbons erupt from thin air, attempting to engulf the target in official documentation and bind them in place.
- Choose one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 impact damage and become Administratively Restrained.

While Administratively Restrained:
- The target’s movement speed becomes 0.

While affected:- The target has disadvantage on Charisma checks involving persuasion, performance, or decorum.- The effect ends early if the creature spends an action to scrape or wash off the muck.

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a notarized corporate injunction, stamped with a priority enforcement seal)
**Acquisition Note:** :: Must be notarized by an A.S.T.R.A.L.-approved arbiter. Attempting to fake the document may result in legal consequences.

With a gesture of bureaucratic authority, you impose a legalistic anomaly upon a target, making it impossible for them to take action until the proper paperwork is processed—which, conveniently, never arrives.
 
- The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they experience an overwhelming sense of procedural restriction, unable to move, attack, or take actions unless they can successfully "file an appeal" at the end of each of their turns (Wisdom saving throw).
- If they attempt to physically force through the effect, they must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, an invisible wall of legal precedent pushes them back 5 feet and the words "ACCESS DENIED" momentarily appear in the air.

A barely visible eye-like shape appears on a ceiling, wall, or corner of a room. The illusion remains for the duration but does not actually perceive anything.

*Cleric, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: nan 
**Components:** :: Verbal 

With a single chant, a surge of prideful energy wraps around your chosen target. This incantation shields them with an aura of indomitable will, reducing the severity of blows that might otherwise pierce their resolve.

Choose one creature within range. The target gains resistance to critical hits for the duration of the spell—any critical hits against them are instead treated as normal hits.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher: Reality trembles slightly, causing a ripple that lingers unseen.

The phantom ship *Elder’s Lament* was last seen adrift in the Void Sea, its captain having invoked Cerulean Incantation of Pride in a desperate bid to escape the Hunt. The ship is still seen, sometimes, but never in the same place twice.
> 
> The very air around Cerulean Incantation of Pride seems to recoil, as if reality itself wishes to avoid acknowledging its existence. It is a spell that should not be, yet is.*

#### Chef's Keen Senses
*2nd-level Divination*
*Ranger*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

Your senses sharpen with uncanny focus as your tongue tingles and your stomach hums like a divining rod. For a brief moment, you are aware of all edible food items within 30 feet—whether fresh, packed, rotten, conjured, or stolen.

You instantly know the location, type, and state of freshness or edibility of every meal, ration, snack, feast, or bite within range—even if it is hidden, obscured, or magically disguised.

At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you also learn:- Whether any food is poisoned, cursed, or tampered with- Whether any food is enchanted, illusory, or anomalous- Whether a meal was prepared with love, bitterness, or obligation (at DM’s discretion)

Early A.S.T.R.A.L. field manuals refer to this spell as Gastro-Thaumic Detection Protocol 4B. However, agents mostly call it The Lunch Sniff. Rumors persist of a rogue variant that once identified a sandwich as “sentient but indifferent.”*

#### Chrono-Administrative Delay
*5th-level Transmutation*
*Wizard, Cleric*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a stamped bureaucratic delay request, attached to a clock frozen at the moment of submission)
**Acquisition Note:** :: Requires a corporate-issued authorization stamp. Unregistered delays may be flagged for administrative review.

You delay the effects of an action, spell, or attack by one round. The affected action still happens, but only after a bureaucratically determined amount of time has passed—enemies and allies alike feel the weight of red tape preventing immediate resolution.

**Arcane Strain:**
Using this spell more than once within 24 hours inflicts Moderate Arcane Strain.

*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a broken clock)

You unleash a violent pulse of temporal distortion that briefly accelerates and then reverses time for everything caught within it.  

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take 6d8 temporal damage, their body suffering from cellular whiplash as it is forced to relive a few seconds of extreme physical stress in reverse and fast-forward. On a success, they take half damage.

Twist of Time: If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by this spell, their body appears to freeze mid-motion for 1 round, during which they cannot be healed or revived by any means—time refuses to move forward for them.

- For 1 minute, the target suffers disadvantage on Intelligence and Charisma checks as their mind reels from the implications.  

On a successful save, the target takes half damage and suffers no further effect.

**Casting Time:** :: Reaction (when an enemy attacks)
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes (Concentration) 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal, Material (a rose petal dipped in honey)

Roll 1d6 immediately upon casting to determine a specific additional effect:

Roleplay Potential:
- This spell can cause considerable confusion and social chaos in delicate or diplomatic settings.
- Cultures sensitive to romantic propriety might ban or heavily regulate its use.

| d6 | Random Effect (Love or Lust?)                                                                                             |
|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | The target falls hopelessly in love with the nearest inanimate object, becoming protective and affectionate toward it.    |
| 2  | The target becomes incredibly awkward for 1 hour, imposing disadvantage on all Charisma checks and saves.                 |
| 3  | The target is overcome by romantic impulse and spontaneously proposes marriage to you.                                    |
| 4  | The target gains a +2 bonus to AC due to heightened adrenaline but is unable to attack any creature they find attractive. |
| 5  | The target takes 1d4 psychic damage from embarrassment as they recall every humiliating moment of their romantic past.    |
| 6  | A whimsical Cupid-like being appears, openly judging and criticizing the target’s romantic choices for 1 minute.          |

**Blood Pact:** Pleasure Numbing

An incomplete footnote in a partially corrupted A.S.T.R.A.L. record vaguely describes a “linguistic corruption phenomenon” causing test subjects to irreversibly blur intimacy, enchantment, and compulsion. The rest of the archive is suspiciously absent.*

#### Commoner's Glow-up
*2nd-level Transmutation*
*Cleric, Sorcerer, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 500 ft.
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic 

You cast a radiant veil over a creature, causing their appearance to elevate dramatically in status and confidence. Their clothes become elegant or fashion-forward (appropriate to the culture), their grooming perfect, and their posture striking. Even their aura suggests wealth, success, or nobility.

For the duration:- The target is perceived as wealthier, more influential, or better connected than they actually are.- They gain advantage on Charisma (Persuasion, Performance, or Deception) checks made to impress, manipulate, or gain favor from upper-class individuals.- Creatures of lower social standing may act deferential or assume the target outranks them.

At Higher Levels:

When cast with a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you may affect up to three additional creatures within range. Each creature may choose a different glamor (e.g., fashion mogul, noble, executive, avant-garde performer).

Originally misfiled as a peasant-upgrade joke, Disguise Glow-Up has since been used to bypass velvet ropes, crash board meetings, and seduce high-ranking officials into leaking sensitive documents.

#### Compelled Broadcast

*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a corporate badge, prominently displayed)

By invoking an obligatory disclosure clause, you compel a creature within range to publicly state an official message, as though it were a corporate press release or legally mandated testimony.
 
- The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they must immediately speak a declarative statement chosen by the caster.
- The speech must be delivered in an official tone, and the target will rationalize why they are making the statement as though it were a compliance requirement.
- If the statement is factually untrue, the target may attempt a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each turn to shake off the compulsion.
 
- If the caster is wearing an official uniform, badge, or legal insignia, the target has disadvantage on their saving throw.

**Anomaly Effect:**
- If overused, the spell may trigger an automated audit, requiring the caster to justify their actions to an unknown, bureaucratic force.

#### Compulsed Sponsoring
*2nd-level Transmutation*
*Bard, Wizard, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 500 ft.
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

You infuse a creature with an irresistible compulsion to endorse a random corporate product. The target must make a Charisma saving throw or immediately produce a branded item from their person and begin promoting it in an unnervingly enthusiastic tone. The item:- Is conjured from a pocket, bag, or sleeve, regardless of size or logic.- Bears a fictional or obscure corporate logo.- Is typically useless, outdated, or completely unrelated to the current situation (e.g., toaster, pager, mascara wand, premium glue stick, commemorative mug).

While holding the item, the creature is incapable of speaking or casting spells unless their words involve endorsing the product. This effect ends at the start of their next turn.

On a roll of 1 on a d20 when the item appears, the product is mildly cursed—e.g., causes static shocks, whispers corporate slogans at night, or leaks black ink that can’t be cleaned.

Casting this spell at 3rd level or higher causes multiple creatures (up to your spellcasting modifier) within range to be affected simultaneously, each with a different product.

**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

You summon a trivial but deeply irritating inconvenience to plague a creature or small area within range. No damage is dealt, and no serious harm is inflicted—just mild frustration.

Roll a d10 and consult the Chaos Table below to determine the exact annoyance:

Clarifications:- The inconvenience is purely cosmetic, causing no damage or severe disadvantage.- The DM can creatively adjust minor details based on the narrative scenario.

| d10 | Minor Annoyance (Chaos Table)                                               |
|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | A sock disappears from the target’s foot, never to be found again.          |
| 2   | A sudden, unbearable itch appears exactly where the target can't reach.      |
| 3   | The target’s shoelaces immediately untie themselves repeatedly for 1 minute. |
| 4   | A random book or document the target is holding becomes incorrectly labeled, causing confusion. |
| 5   | The target’s keys or similar small personal item vanish momentarily, reappearing only after thorough searching. |
| 6   | An annoying dripping sound emanates nearby but has no identifiable source.   |
| 7   | The target’s clothes become slightly uncomfortable—too itchy, tight, or loose—for exactly one minute. |
| 8   | A persistent and unexplained humming noise surrounds the target, audible only to them. |
| 9   | Every surface the target touches for the next minute feels oddly sticky.     |
| 10  | A harmless but persistent fly or insect buzzes around the target’s face, impossible to swat or catch. |

**Casting Time:** :: 1 minute
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: Special

You whisper the Old Words into the void, and something answers.
 
- A succubus or incubus materializes in your presence, bound to fulfill the caster’s desires, but at an unknown cost.

- If the entity interacts with another person, they too must make the saving throw.

With a weaponized application of administrative inefficiency, you impose a mandatory review process on your target, delaying their next action by one full round.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure:
 
- Their action does not occur until the start of their next turn.
- If they attempt to resist the delay, they must spend their bonus action and reaction attempting to "process" the action instead of completing it.
- If the spell is countered by a corporate-affiliated caster, both casters must roll competing Intelligence checks to determine whose bureaucratic force wins out.

Additional Effect: If cast against an entity that operates under strict corporate, military, or legal structures, they suffer disadvantage on the save.

 The item remains for 10 minutes before fading into an encrypted data lock. If destroyed or stolen, the caster receives a corporate reprimand, imposing disadvantage on persuasion checks with corporate agents for 24 hours.

**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

The moment you are subjected to forced obedience, you generate a reality anchor pulse, disrupting the compulsion.

*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, their mind experiences a catastrophic logical error, freezing their ability to process information. They cannot take actions, bonus actions, or reactions, and automatically fail Intelligence-based checks and saves for the duration.

*Wizard, Bard, Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Duration:** :: Permanent 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a frayed Ethernet cable or a broken quill)
**Acquisition Note:** :: Overuse may trigger a corporate forensic audit, leading to investigations or countermeasures.

This spell scrambles, distorts, or falsifies data rather than erasing it, creating misleading, contradictory, or corrupted information.

- Digital records are glitched, filled with anomalies, false timestamps, and conflicting logs.
- Physical records appear heavily altered or rewritten, as if they’ve been tampered with.
- Magical records (divination-based archives, memory storage, etc.) become unreliable, causing vague or conflicting results when reviewed.
- Anyone analyzing the data must make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to notice inconsistencies.
 
 The corruption is permanent unless manually repaired by a skilled technician, hacker, or archivist.

*3rd-level Divination*
*Wizard, Bard*

**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a corrupted USB drive)
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
**Acquisition Note:** :: Repeated use may attract corporate counter-infiltration specialists or trigger a data breach investigation.

---

*Wizard, Cleric, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 120 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a terminal with administrative access)

You invoke a catastrophic memory purge, erasing all stored information within a creature’s mind and body. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, it takes 15d10 cognitive damage and forgets all spells and abilities for 1 minute. On a success, it takes half damage and suffers no effect.
 
 A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell is permanently erased from all records, including memories, archives, and digital storage. Only a wish spell or divine intervention can restore them.

**Arcane Strain:**
Major Arcane Strain – Memory fragmentation or long-term reality instability may occur.

---

#### Data Recovery
*2nd-level Necromancy*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a data storage crystal or memory chip)

You restore memory loss, brain fog, or neurological corruption in a willing creature.

This spell removes the following conditions if they are the result of psychic overload, anomaly exposure, or cognitive corruption:
- Paranoid  
- Frightened  
- Stunned  
- Compelled  
- Aroused *(if caused by enchantment)*  

It does not remove magical Charmed effects or active enchantments. However, it halts the progression of long-term neurological decline, such as memory decay caused by exposure to forbidden glyphs, mnemonic rot, or containment leaks.

---

#### Data Scramble
*1st-level Illusion*
*Wizard, Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

Touching a digital device, you cause its stored data to become incomprehensible, garbled, or distorted. Any attempt to retrieve or access the data requires an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the data remains unreadable for the duration.

Using this spell on government or corporate systems may trigger counter-security measures.

---

#### Dead Air

*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Material (a broken radio knob)

You disrupt sound waves in a localized area. Until the start of your next turn, all spoken words within range are slightly distorted, causing messages to come out garbled and difficult to understand. If cast near a radio or intercom, the device crackles with static for one round.

---

#### Delayed Nap
*3rd-level Enchantment*
*Druid, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Reaction (when an ally takes damage)
**Range:**        :: 120 ft.
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Somatic 

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
You designate a target and whisper a temporal lullaby encoded with latent enchantment. The spell does not take effect immediately—instead, you set a delay of 1, 2, or 3 rounds (your choice when casting). When the timer ends, the effect detonates.- The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or fall unconscious for the duration.- While unconscious, they can be awakened by taking damage or being shaken awake.- If the target is already asleep when the spell activates, they instead experience vivid hallucinations and speak in an unknown language. For the next hour, they have disadvantage on Insight checks and occasionally murmur anomalous phrases.- On a successful save, the target resists the effect and instead gains one level of fatigue for 1 hour, as their internal clock momentarily collapses.

When cast using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you may affect one additional creature per level beyond 3rd. All targets must be within 30 feet of one another.

Survivors of the spell’s effects often complain of waking up in a body that feels slightly… borrowed.*

#### Desynchronization Pulse
*4th-level Transmutation*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet (10-foot radius sphere)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

You create a field of unstable time that warps the moment of impact. Creatures in the area take 6d10 impact damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they are phased slightly out of time, suffering disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws until the end of their next turn.
 
 At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 per slot level above 4th.

**Arcane Strain:**
Moderate Arcane Strain – Minor temporal instability, brief perception shifts, or momentary déjà vu effects.

---

#### Detect Broadcasts
*1st-level Divination*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self (30 feet)
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a copper wire earpiece)

You convert arcane energy into an analog signal, allowing you to transmit a spoken message or magical effect through radio waves, telegraph lines, or wired technology. Spells like *Ciphered Message* and *Ghost Broadcast* can be cast across vast distances if a signal relay exists.

 | Encryption Level | BDR |
 |------------------------|------|
 | Basic encryption  | 10  |
 | Corporate-grade | 15  |
 | Military-grade  | 18  |
 | Eldritch interference | 22  |

**Anomaly Effect:**
Repeated use may cause phantom transmissions—garbled messages from entities who should not be listening.

---

#### Dice Storm
*Cantrip Evocation*
*Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Selft Radius/10 ft
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

You call upon the fractured laws of probability, summoning a swirling rain of polyhedral objects—tiny magical dice—within a 10-foot radius centered on you. The clattering projectiles slam into everything nearby.

Each creature of your choice in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 impact damage. On a successful save, they take half damage. The damage is nonlethal unless otherwise specified.

Chaos Surge:

Immediately after casting, roll a d20. On a natural 20, the dice manifest as larger and denser projectiles (e.g., d20s the size of coconuts). Choose one of the following critical effects, or let the DM improvise:- The target is knocked prone.- One object in the area is crushed or broken.- A random magical effect is triggered (see Wild Magic surge table).- The area becomes difficult terrain until the end of your next turn (covered in slippery dice).- You regain 1 hit point (the dice land just right to boost your morale).

At Higher Levels:

The spell’s damage increases as you gain levels:- 5th level: 3d6- 11th level: 4d6- 17th level: 5d6

At 11th level and above, the storm includes d12s and d20s. Damage remains nonlethal, but now causes loud, disorienting clatter (creatures have disadvantage on Stealth checks until the end of their next turn).

Originally cataloged under “d1.ce” by A.S.T.R.A.L., this anomaly manifested during a failed probability containment test. The storm is still considered a Class-1 hazard in casinos, board rooms, and office game nights.*

#### Digital Collapse
*6th-level Evocation*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a corrupted hard drive)

A creature of your choice within range must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, its nervous system short-circuits, dealing 8d8 electric damage and incapacitating it until the end of its next turn. If the creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also blinded for 1 minute.

 At Higher Levels. When cast using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 per level.

---

#### Digital Ghost
*5th-level Necromancy*
*Wizard, Cleric, Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 1 hour 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a broken computer chip)

The soul of a recently deceased creature is uploaded into a technological system instead of passing on. Their essence lingers in the digital realm, allowing them to communicate, interact with data, and haunt technology within the range.

**Arcane Strain:**
Moderate Arcane Strain – Fragmented consciousness, occasional memory distortion.

---

#### Dimensional Hard Reset
*4th-level Abjuration*
*Cleric, Wizard, Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a broken clock hand)

You unleash a stabilizing wave of reality enforcement, forcing all anomalies, rifts, and unstable entities in the area to conform to baseline existence.
 
- Low-tier anomalies (CR 5 or lower) are immediately neutralized, vanishing or becoming mundane versions of themselves.
- Higher-tier anomalies (CR 6-15) must make a Charisma saving throw or become suppressed for 1 minute, temporarily losing any paranormal traits.
- Powerful anomalies (CR 16+) experience severe disruption, suffering disadvantage on all ability checks, attacks, and saving throws related to their supernatural nature for 1 minute.
 
 Additionally, any dimensional rifts, glitches, or overlapping timelines in range forcibly snap shut, preventing further distortions unless reactivated with powerful magic.

>- 6th level: Anomalies of CR 10 or lower are fully erased.
 >- 8th level: Anomalies of CR 15 or lower cannot resist the effect.
 >- 9th level: The spell becomes an absolute reset, affecting all anomalies regardless of CR.

#### Dimensional Layover
*4th-level Conjuration*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes (or until exited) 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a stopwatch frozen at midnight)

You conjure a temporary "layover space", a pocket of non-time where events pause but awareness remains intact.
 
- Up to 6 creatures within range are shifted into an alternate copy of the location, appearing slightly out of sync with reality.
- Time outside continues normally, but within the layover, no external force can interact with you.
- Spells, attacks, and actions do not leave the space—but you can watch reality play out through an invisible window, letting you gather information.

**Anomaly Effect:**
If you stay too long, external reality might forget you exist, causing minor distortions when you return.

---

#### Dimensional Slip
*3rd-level Transmutation*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

You shift between dimensions unpredictably. At the start of your turn, roll a d6:
- 1-2: Gain resistance to all damage
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
- 3-4: Teleport 30 feet in a random direction
- 5-6: Gain invisibility for 1 turn

---

#### Dimensional Spillover
*3rd-level Conjuration*
*Bard, Cleric, Wizard, Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 minute
**Range:**        :: Self (10-foot radius)
**Duration:** :: 8 hours 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a key from an unknown origin)

You create a temporary extradimensional shelter, but its interior is never the same. Each casting opens a distinct pocket realm with unpredictable architecture—an abandoned office, a forgotten train station, a maintenance shaft that shouldn’t exist. The space is secure, offering rest and protection, but anomalies sometimes manifest inside, leaving subtle signs that the shelter was briefly occupied by something else.

---

#### Directional Sense
*Cantrip Evocation*
*Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Terrain 
**Terrain:** :: Endless Hallways

You focus your senses, allowing the pulse of magic to resonate through the terrain around you. This pulse reveals the optimal path forward, guiding your movements with precision. Whether in dense forests, city streets, or endless hallways, the flow of magic sharpens your awareness of the shortest and safest route.- Effect:- For the duration of the spell, you gain the ability to automatically find the shortest path to your desired destination within range. This can be a physical route, avoiding obstacles like walls or difficult terrain, or identifying pathways hidden or obscured by illusion magic.- You do not become disoriented or confused by labyrinths, mazes, or other disorienting environments.

At Higher Levels:- 5th Level: You can now detect multiple routes (such as secondary exits or alternate pathways) and choose the safest or most efficient.- 11th Level: The range of the spell increases to 120 feet, and you gain the ability to perceive hidden or magical paths, such as secret doors or enchanted routes.

The flow of energy pulses through the stone beneath your feet, and your senses expand beyond your immediate surroundings. As the pulse of magic spreads outward, the shifting walls of a labyrinth reveal their true layout, and you are guided with an unnatural certainty toward your destination.*

#### Dirge Pulse
*Cantrip Necromancy*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

You release a low, resonant tone that only the dying can hear. Any creature within range that is at 0 hit points and making death saving throws automatically stabilizes if it succeeds on its next death saving throw. If an undead creature is within range, it takes 1 cognitive damage as the resonance disrupts its form.

---

#### Disciplinary Reassignment
*7th-level Enchantment*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 hour
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Duration:** :: Permanent 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a stamped reassignment order)

A creature that fails a Wisdom saving throw is assigned a new life.
- They forget who they were and assume a new corporate-approved persona.
- They believe they have always held this false identity.
- Any attempt to convince them otherwise fails unless *Wish* or *Greater Restoration* is used.

---

#### Discover Unseen Trace
*3rd-level Divination*
*Cleric, Druid, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Reaction (when an object is thrown at you)
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 30 minutes 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
You attune your senses to latent traces left behind by recently departed creatures. For the duration, you can perceive invisible bio-trails, residual aura smudges, or paranormal displacement fields that linger behind living beings.- Within a 60-foot radius, you can detect the most recent trace left by any creature that passed through in the last hour.- The trace manifests as a faint shimmer, footprint, or scent only you can perceive.- On close inspection (action), you can learn one of the following:- Species or general creature type (humanoid, beast, aberration, etc.)- Time since presence- Anomalous conditions, such as illness, magical residue, or emotional trauma

At Higher Levels:

When cast using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can:- Analyze up to 3 traces simultaneously, or- Gain additional information such as diet, injury patterns, or arcane corruption.

A censored note in Zachary Rogers’ Black Site logs reads: “We used to follow footprints. Now we follow echoes. But the echoes are starting to echo back.”*

#### Dissonant Gestation
*4th-level Necromancy*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 hour
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Permanent (until birth or surgical removal) 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a handful of grave dirt, pressed into the skin)

You implore the dark corners of reality to place an unseen burden within a creature’s body—not a pregnancy, but an unnatural gestation, a thing that grows, waits, and feeds.
 
- The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, something begins to gestate inside them, though it is not a living creature as they understand it.
- Each week, roll a d6 to determine the nature of the thing growing within:
- 1 | Bone Nesting – The target’s bones begin splitting, reforming, and growing redundantly, fusing in painful, alien configurations.
- 2 | Chitinous Hatchery – Their flesh hardens into a shell, and something moves beneath it. It will hatch, but no one knows what.
- 3 | Hollow Incubation – The target’s organs begin to disappear, one by one, yet they remain alive, feeling the empty space within.
- 4 | Blood Evolution – Their blood is no longer theirs, but something else’s, moving independently, making them a host for an unseen parasite.
- 5 | Neural Infestation – The target begins hearing a second set of thoughts inside their mind. These are not theirs. They whisper secrets.
- 6 | Aberrant Bloom – Strange tendrils or appendages occasionally emerge from the target’s body, retreating before they can be seen.
 
 Ending the Spell:
- If left untreated, at the end of three months, the thing inside them will be born. The result is not predictable, and it may not be survivable.
- The only way to remove the gestation is through surgery or another, more powerful anomaly.

**Anomaly Effect:**
- If multiple creatures are affected by this spell in the same location, their gestating entities begin to sync, forming a single, distributed intelligence between all hosts.

#### Distributed Regeneration
*3rd-level Transmutation*
*Cleric, Artificer, Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet (up to 3 creatures)
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a vial of cloned stem cells)

Up to three creatures in range regain 1d8 HP at the start of each of their turns. If they are missing any limbs, this spell initiates slow regrowth over 1d4 days.

---

#### Doppler Sound
*Cantrip Divination*
*Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60ft
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Terrain 
**Terrain:** :: Subway Tiles

You attune yourself to the subtle shifts in the air, using the ambient sounds of the environment to perceive the movement of creatures around you. Through the echoes in the terrain, you sense the direction and speed of any creature moving within range.- Effect:- You can detect the direction and speed of any creature within 60 feet that is moving. This allows you to sense their general movement, such as whether they are approaching, retreating, or moving laterally.- You cannot detect the exact position, but you can pinpoint the movement relative to your position.

At Higher Levels:- 5th Level: You can detect the number of creatures moving, as well as their general size.- 11th Level: The range of detection extends to 120 feet, and you can now detect creatures that are attempting to hide or move stealthily, though you do not discern exact details about their hiding place.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
As you focus on the sounds around you, the once-faint hum of the environment sharpens into something more defined. The echoes in the subway tiles vibrate with subtle patterns, giving you an almost instinctual understanding of what is moving around you, where they are headed, and how fast they are traveling.*

---

#### Dorkvision
*2nd-level Divination*
*Paladin, Ranger, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 ft.
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic 

You gain the uncanny ability to detect the presence of nerds, dweebs, and individuals of exceptional dweebosity within 60 feet—even through walls, floors, or ceilings. The spell provides no other visual enhancements: no darkvision, no object outlines—just a glowing nerd-silhouette pulsing with arcane awkwardness.

You do not learn the creature’s identity, species, alignment, or abilities—only that a certified dork is present.

At Higher Levels:
When cast using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you also perceive the creature’s clothing—or lack thereof. However, the target becomes instantly and uncomfortably aware of being watched, regardless of distance, barriers, or logic.

Important Notes:- This spell does not grant darkvision, blindsight, or any combat utility.- This spell is considered deeply unethical by most academies and banned in all Concord City libraries.

| d4 | Target's Reaction (Optional DM Flavor)        |
|----|-----------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Looks around suspiciously and says "huh?"     |
| 2  | Pulls jacket tighter and backs away nervously |
| 3  | Makes prolonged eye contact with a camera     |
| 4  | Opens a book and whispers "I know you're there." |

#### Drain Cognition
*3rd-level Necromancy*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a spent memory chip)

You extract fragments of knowledge from the target’s mind. They must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, their spell save DC and Intelligence-based ability checks are reduced by 2d4 for the duration.

---

#### Drifting Echo
*Cantrip Divination*
*Bard, Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a broken tuning fork)

You release a thin pulse of sound, inaudible to the living, but receptive to echoes of the past.
 
For the duration, you can hear vague, distorted murmurs of events that occurred in the area within the past hour. These sounds are indistinct and fragmented but may provide clues about recent conversations, movement, or disturbances.

The clarity of the echo depends on an Intelligence (Investigation) check made against your spell save DC:

---

#### Dripping Hour
*Cantrip Transmutation*
*Sorcerer, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

Time fractures briefly around a small object of your choice within range. A flickering afterimage of the object appears where it was exactly one second ago, causing momentary confusion. A creature interacting with the object must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be unable to distinguish which version is real until the start of your next turn.

---

#### Drowsing Embrace
*2nd-level Enchantment*
*Bard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes/level 
**Components:** :: Somatic 

This black-market neural suppressant induces an instantaneous sleep state in the target following a physical exchange (e.g., a kiss).
 
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
- The target remains unconscious unless physically harmed or awakened by external stimuli.
- Standard noise does not disrupt the sleep.
- The reverse version of this spell, "Biometric Reboot," instantly awakens a magically asleep individual.
 
 Used extensively in high-end escort services, medical sedation programs, and certain interrogation tactics.

#### Duinir's Respite of Flames
*2nd-level Abjuration*
*Sorcerer, Wizard, Cleric, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (dehydrated fruit)

A flicker of protective warmth, traced from forgotten runes and smoldering remnants of a scholar’s last memory, pulses outward from your hands. You call upon Duinir’s ward—a memory, a flame, a sanctuary encoded in contradiction.

Choose up to 3 creatures within range. Each target gains 2d4 temporary hit points and becomes immune to the charmed condition for the duration.

While under this spell’s effects, affected creatures emit a faint, heatless ember-glow from their chest when they are emotionally manipulated or magically influenced—visible only in dim light or darkness.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher:
Reality trembles slightly, causing a ripple that lingers unseen. The air smells faintly of burnt parchment and oranges.

Before the disaster at Hollowwatch, scribes documented the sudden, inexplicable disappearance of a scholar who had been researching Duinir's Respite of Flames. The books on his desk were found neatly stacked, except for one—a tome that had no title, and no pages inside.
> 
> Ancient tablets unearthed beneath the ruins of Gilded Hollow show early inscriptions of Duinir's Respite of Flames, yet none can determine the language it was written in. The characters shift when no one is looking.*

#### Duinir’s Ember Aegis
*2nd-level Abjuration*
*Cleric, Wizard, Paladin, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (A coal from a long-dead hearth)

You infuse a creature with a protective ember shield. The first time they take damage within the duration, flames lash out at the attacker, dealing 2d6 pyric damage. Additionally, the target has resistance to pyric damage for the duration.

At 4th level, the retaliatory pyric damage increases to 3d6.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher: Reality trembles slightly, causing a ripple that lingers unseen.

The last known user of Duinir’s Ember Aegis, the warlock Darsil Veil, was found with his eyes hollowed out and his veins scorched black. His journal spoke of 'the whispering ones' who demanded a price for forbidden knowledge.
> 
> There are words that should not be spoken, thoughts that should not be held. Duinir’s Ember Aegis is one such secret—a spell that fractures reality just enough for something else to listen.*

#### Dust Veil
*Cantrip Illusion*
*Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 1 round 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Terrain 
**Terrain:** :: Crumbling Concrete

A sudden gust of dust rises from the ground, swirling around you in a blinding veil. The particles obscure your form, making it harder for enemies to land a blow.- Effect:- When you are attacked, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll against you for the duration of the round.- The dust is drawn from the terrain, and the effect is strongest in areas where the environment is gritty or decaying (such as crumbling concrete).

At Higher Levels:- 5th Level: The dust cloud lasts for 2 rounds instead of 1.- 11th Level: The radius of the cloud increases to cover a 10-foot area around you, granting disadvantage on all attack rolls against creatures within the area.

As you step, the ground beneath you cracks and a cloud of dust erupts into the air, swirling around your form in a cloud of obscurity. The air feels thick with sand as your enemies struggle to focus through the haze, their vision distorted by the fine particles swirling in every direction.*

#### Dyrnar's Doom of Despair
*7th-level Necromancy*
*Cleric, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 ft
**Duration:** :: nan 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a vial of springwater)

You speak a cursed word in a language not meant for mortals, invoking the forbidden knowledge of Dyrnar’s Doom. Choose one creature within range. The target becomes marked for death. Lines of black sigils appear on the target’s hands and neck, and the target learns that they will die in 4d8 + 12 hours unless certain conditions are met. They know how much time they have and how to avoid the doom:
	1.	Curse Removal: The target can make a successful Wisdom saving throw at the end of each day to break the curse.
	2.	Kill a Humanoid: The target must kill a humanoid within the time frame to delay the curse. The humanoid must be a creature capable of being killed by the target.

If the conditions are not met, the target dies when the time expires.

The sigils continue to spread as the time runs out, covering the target’s body in dark ink. If the conditions are met or the curse is removed, the sigils vanish, and the target is freed from the impending doom.

Saving Throw: Wisdom save to resist being marked for death.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a roll of 15 or higher, reality trembles slightly, causing a ripple that lingers unseen. This subtle shift in the balance may leave its marks on the world, though it is not always clear what effect it will have.

The last known user of Dyrnar's Doom of Despair, the warlock Darsil Veil, was found with his eyes hollowed out and his veins scorched black. His journal spoke of 'the whispering ones' who demanded a price for forbidden knowledge.
> 
> There are words that should not be spoken, thoughts that should not be held. Dyrnar's Doom of Despair is one such secret—a spell that fractures reality just enough for something else to listen.*

#### Dyrnar’s Tormentous Wail
*4th-level Necromancy*
*Cleric, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet Cone
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic (A desiccated tongue wrapped in silk)

You exhale a shriek that does not come from your lungs. It comes from somewhere much deeper—a place beneath time and flesh. The wail drags the psychic residue of forgotten horrors into the minds of those who hear it.

Each creature in a 30-foot cone must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is frightened for 1 minute. If the creature fails by 5 or more, it also suffers 5d6 cognitive damage as ancestral screams claw through its mind.

A frightened creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

At Higher Levels. When cast using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the range increases to a 60-foot cone.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher:
Reality trembles slightly, causing a ripple that lingers unseen.

**Blood Pact:** Oath of Blood

In the city of Concord, Dyrnar’s Tormentous Wail is outlawed, for it was once used by the cult of the Silent Maw to unmake a senator in broad daylight. Witnesses swore they saw his shadow scream before vanishing entirely.
> 
> Those who cast the wail often find that they dream differently afterward. They dream of corridors that stretch into infinity, doors that lead to places older than time.*

#### Echo of the Forgotten
*6th-level Necromancy*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a memory fragment from an erased soul)

You summon an anomaly-born specter that fights for you. It has AC 16, HP 60, flight, and resistance to nonmagical damage. It attacks with cognitive tendrils (2d10 damage) and can phase through solid surfaces. It obeys only direct commands and disappears if ignored.

---

#### Echo of the Hallowed Ground
*2nd-level Abjuration*
*Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self 30 ft Aura
**Duration:** :: Up to 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a pinch of consecrated ash)

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
While this spell is active, your aura reflects the memory of sanctified or desecrated ground. For the duration:- Your Aura of Sanctity applies even if the terrain is not currently Holy or Unholy.- You gain a faint glowing aura (or a flickering shadow) that reveals your allegiance.- If you cast Consecrate or Corrupt during the duration, the effect becomes instantaneous and cannot be interrupted by damage.

Note: This spell allows you to “prime” a battlefield without needing the terrain benefit immediately, making it more tactical.

#### Echo of the Lost
*Cantrip Divination*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 15 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Material (a piece of charred bone)

You briefly attune yourself to lingering impressions of the past. You hear a single whispered sentence in a language you understand, spoken by a creature that was in the area within the past 24 hours. The sentence is random, chosen by the DM, and may or may not be useful. If no creature was in the area within that time, you instead hear a distant, meaningless murmur.

| DC Range       | Effect Description                                                                 |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 10 or lower    | Incoherent murmurs, difficult to interpret.                                         |
| 11–15          | Disjointed words or partial sentences.                                              |
| 16+            | A full phrase or clear statement relevant to the past event.                        |

#### Echo of the Overheard
*Cantrip Divination*
*Bard, Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 15 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Material (a bent paperclip)

By attuning to the residual vibrations in the air, you briefly hear a snippet of a conversation that took place in the area within the last 10 minutes. The words are often out of context, distorted, or incomplete, requiring interpretation.

---

#### Echoes of the Forgotten
*5th-level Necromancy*
*Wizard, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet 20-foot-radius sphere
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (A whisper trapped in a glass vial)

You fracture the veil of memory and call forth the voices of the long-dead—those whose names were erased, whose deaths were forgotten. In a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range, spectral murmurs begin to rise, growing louder until they echo with unbearable presence.

Each creature in the area must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they are frightened and deafened for the duration. While frightened in this way, they perceive haunting whispers describing their worst regrets, lost memories, or alternate lives that could have been.

A creature that ends its turn in the area must repeat the saving throw.

At Higher Levels. When cast with a spell slot of 7th level or higher, affected creatures also take 3d6 cognitive damage at the start of each turn they remain in the area.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher:
Reality trembles slightly, causing a ripple that lingers unseen.

The last known user of Echoes of the Forgotten, the warlock Darsil Veil, was found with his eyes hollowed out and his veins scorched black. His journal spoke of 'the whispering ones' who demanded a price for forbidden knowledge.

#### Echoing Pulse of Time
*7th-level Transmutation*
*Wizard, Sorcerer, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self 30-foot radius
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (A watch with a cracked face)

You fracture the timeline around you, surrounding yourself in rippling echoes of potential futures and discarded pasts. While the spell is active, time fractures and repairs itself in chaotic pulses.
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

At Higher Levels.
When cast using a 9th-level spell slot, you may roll twice each turn and choose the result.

| d6 Roll | Temporal Effect                                                                                      |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1–2     | Slowed Flow – Enemies within range have disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the start of your next turn. |
| 3–4     | Accelerated Momentum – You may take a second bonus action this turn.                             |
| 5       | Echo Step – You teleport up to 15 feet to a location you occupied on your last turn.             |
| 6       | Temporal Mirror – A flickering afterimage of yourself performs the same action you just did (repeating your action once, targeting a different creature if possible; no additional cost). |

**Anomaly Effect:**
Anomaly Effect:
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher: Reality trembles slightly, causing a ripple that lingers unseen.

The rogue artificer Veyl Renshaw designed an enchanted device that could replicate Echoing Pulse of Time. She activated it only once—her house was later found standing, but all its doors opened into an endless void.
> 
> To cast Echoing Pulse of Time is to invite a presence that does not belong. The words taste of static, the gestures feel like echoes of hands not your own.*

#### Echoing Stomp
*Cantrip Evocation*
*Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10ft radius
**Duration:** :: Instant 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Terrain 
**Terrain:** :: Wooden Floor

You stomp your foot with great force, sending a shockwave reverberating through the wooden floor beneath you. The sound echoes with a force that temporarily disrupts your enemies.- Effect:- All creatures within a 10-foot radius must make a Constitution saving throw.- On a failed save, creatures lose their reaction until the start of their next turn, stunned by the reverberation of the stomp.- Creatures that fail the saving throw also take 1d6 sonic damage as the shockwave disrupts their senses.

At Higher Levels:- 5th Level: The radius of the shockwave increases to 15 feet.- 11th Level: The damage increases to 2d6 sonic damage.

You stamp your foot firmly, and the floor trembles as the shockwave ripples outward, vibrating through the wood like the crack of thunder. The deafening echo unsettles your foes, leaving them dazed and vulnerable, as the ground beneath them seems to tremble with your power.*

---

#### Eclipse Touch
*Cantrip Abjuration*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 1 round 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

You trace an arcane sigil over a creature’s skin, leaving behind a barely perceptible shimmer. The next time the target takes chiaric damage before the start of your next turn, the damage is reduced by 1d4.

---

#### Efficiency Mode
*4th-level Transmutation*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 1 hour 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a caffeine capsule)

The target enters a state of optimized function. They gain +2 AC, advantage on attack rolls, and resistance to exhaustion effects. However, when the spell ends, they suffer disadvantage on all ability checks for 1 hour.

---

#### Egress Protocol
*2nd-level Enchantment*
*Bard, Ranger*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

You press your hand to the target’s chest, and for a brief moment, you feel their heart stutter—then surge. Their pupils dilate unnaturally as arcane algorithms flood their nervous system, hijacking the primal circuits of fear and survival.

The creature’s body is overridden with reflexive escape routines. For the duration, they gain the following benefits:
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

- Their movement speed increases by 20 feet.
- They gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) and Strength (Athletics) checks.
- They automatically succeed on the first check made to escape a grapple, binding, or restraint.

You won’t *think* about escaping—you’ll *already be gone.*

---

#### Eldritch Intoxication
*2nd-level Enchantment*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a drop of aged absinthe)
**Acquisition Note:** :: See Blood Seal rules for procurement.

You saturate the target’s nervous system with supernatural excess, overloading their body with pleasure, euphoria, and dreamlike sensations.
 
- They gain the Aroused condition.  
- They suffer disadvantage on Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws.  
- Their movement speed is halved as they drift and stagger in a dreamlike trance.  
- They begin to hallucinate, seeing fleeting images of former lovers, unfulfilled desires, or paranormal entities disguised as temptations (chosen by the GM).

If the target fails the saving throw by 10 or more, they lose all grip on reality—treating illusions as truth and mistaking allies for figments or phantoms. They become Paranoid and they cannot willingly target these hallucinated allies with hostile actions unless they are harmed first.

**Anomaly Effect:**
- If a creature fails by 10 or more, they become unable to tell reality from illusion, mistaking allies for dreamlike apparitions.

---

#### Electromagnetic Surge
*2nd-level Evocation*
*Wizard, Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

A sudden burst of static energy surges through a target. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 electric damage and lose all electronic communication for 1 minute. On a successful save, the target takes half damage and suffers no disruption.

 At Higher Levels. When cast using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 per level.

---

#### Emergency Containment Directive
*4th-level Abjuration*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Until dispelled 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (an embossed containment sigil, notarized and stamped with an A.S.T.R.A.L. seal)
**Acquisition Note:** :: Official clearance required. Unauthorized use may lead to A.S.T.R.A.L. investigation.

You etch a binding glyph into the environment, invoking an official A.S.T.R.A.L.-grade spatial lockdown. This containment field is undetectable to the naked eye and can only be revealed by corporate-grade anomaly scanners.

- When a creature first enters the affected space (a 10-foot radius circle centered on the glyph), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become contained within the bureaucratic lockdown.
- A contained creature is mentally shunted into an abstract “waiting room” within the anomaly filing system. While aware of their surroundings, they cannot move, act, or communicate unless presented with a notarized authorization sigil, which is magically created at the time of casting and bound to the spellcaster or a designated entity.
- Creatures that successfully save are unaffected and may pass through freely, but the glyph remains until dispelled or triggered.
- Once triggered, the glyph can no longer detain other creatures.

**Anomaly Effect:**
If the spell is cast too frequently within the same region, higher bureaucratic forces may initiate a dispute over procedural irregularities. This has a 25% chance of causing the glyph to malfunction, possibly detaining the wrong creature or triggering a random bureaucratic anomaly.

---

#### Emergency Resuscitation Protocol
*1st-level Necromancy*
*Cleric, Wizard, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a paramedical-grade defibrillator, registered to an emergency response ID)
**Acquisition Note:** :: Payment can be in credits or a direct transfer of life force (aging the caster by 1 year instead of paying the fee).

You stabilize a dying creature and restore 1d4 + your spellcasting modifier hit points. If the target was unconscious, they wake up disoriented and suffer disadvantage on all rolls for 1 round.

**Arcane Strain:**
Using lifespan instead of credits inflicts Minor Arcane Strain.

---

#### Encrypted Command
*1st-level Enchantment*
*Cleric, Wizard, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 round 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

You speak a single-word command, encoded in an arcane cipher that only the intended target can comprehend. To all other creatures, the word sounds like distorted static, arcane distortion, or nonsensical muttering. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on their next turn, as if affected by the Command spell.

If the target succeeds on their saving throw, they immediately sense that an attempt was made to magically influence their will, though they do not inherently know who cast the spell.

Observers may recognize that a spell was cast but cannot understand the word. A creature within 30 feet who hears the utterance can attempt a DC 13 Arcana or Insight check to discern the nature of the magic, but not the command itself.

When cast using a spell slot of 3nd level or higher, the spell becomes entirely undetectable to anyone except the caster and target—leaving no sound, no visual components, and no magical trace behind.

---

#### Encrypted Containment Protocol
*3rd-level Abjuration*
*Wizard, Cleric, Ranger, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Until dispelled 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a security keycard or anomaly tag)

You inscribe a high-security enchantment on an object, entrance, or containment zone, preventing unauthorized access. This spell combines Encrypted Lockdown and Containment Directive into a more flexible form.
 
- The locked area cannot be picked, hacked, or broken without first making a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) or Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check.
- Magical attempts to bypass the lock (e.g., teleportation, phase shifting) require a DC 18 Charisma save.
- If the target is a creature (anomaly or prisoner), they must succeed on a Strength saving throw to force their way out.

---

#### Encrypted Mind
*3rd-level Abjuration*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 8 hours 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

Your thoughts become fragmented and unreadable. You gain advantage on saving throws against mind-reading effects, telepathic intrusion, and charm effects. Any
 
 attempt to read your mind returns corrupted, incomprehensible data.

---

#### Encrypted Missive
*3rd-level Transmutation*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a functioning electronic device)

You touch a piece of technology and mentally compose a message of up to 25 words. The message is instantly encoded and transmitted through digital infrastructure, reaching its intended recipient through an email, text, or unknown server. This spell ignores firewalls but cannot bypass total disconnection from a network. The recipient hears the message in their mind as if reading it, but it leaves no digital trace.

---

#### Enthralling Kiss
*3rd-level Enchantment*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Until dispelled or broken 
**Components:** :: Somatic (S a kiss)
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

You place an enchanting kiss upon a humanoid creature you touch, compelling it to regard you as an authoritative presence worthy of obedience. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw at disadvantage. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed, treating you as a trusted authority figure, willing to comply with most non-hostile requests and instructions.

While charmed, the target experiences a strong compulsion to remain within 10 feet of you. At the end of each of its turns, the target may repeat the Wisdom saving throw (without disadvantage); success allows it to move freely until the start of its next turn.

The charm persists indefinitely until it is dispelled, you become hostile toward the target, or the target takes damage.

At Higher Levels:
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you may affect one additional humanoid for each slot level above 1st. Each target must be kissed separately within the same action.

Common in corporate negotiation tactics and underground consent override procedures.*

---

#### Erased Footsteps
*Cantrip Transmutation*
*Ranger, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

You alter the way a surface registers footprints. For the duration, a touched floor, rug, or dirt path erases any traces of movement within a 5-foot radius. Creatures attempting to track someone through this area must make a Wisdom (Survival) check against your spell save DC.

---

#### Erasure of Pain
*7th-level Enchantment*
*Cleric, Bard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 hour 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a pill dissolving in water)

Up to 6 creatures of your choice in range become immune to pain, fear, and exhaustion for 1 hour. This spell does not remove injuries but suppresses all negative physical sensations.

---

#### Escalate to Management
*4th-level Enchantment*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 hour 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a corporate memo)

Target one humanoid. They must make a Wisdom saving throw or become convinced that their current issue is “not their problem” and must be escalated to a higher authority. They will refuse to engage further until a superior intervenes.

- On a failure, they gain the Paranoid condition and become convinced that their current task or conflict is “not their jurisdiction.”  
- While Paranoid in this way, they will actively avoid confrontation, refuse to complete objectives, and demand the presence of a superior or authoritative figure.
- In combat, they will take the Dodge action unless directly attacked, and will spend their turns muttering about policy violations or escalation procedures.  
- They may only repeat the saving throw at the end of each hour, or when confronted by a creature they recognize as a superior.

On a successful save, the target shrugs off the compulsion, but suffers disadvantage on their next ability check or attack roll as lingering doubt creeps in. 

I’m afraid I’m not authorized to deal with that. You’ll need to speak with management.*

---

#### Eternal Memo
*1st-level Transmutation*
*Wizard, Cleric*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Permanent 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a paper receipt)

You inscribe a message, signature, or contract onto a non-living object, embedding it permanently into reality. It cannot be erased, burned, or defaced except by a reality altering spell or anomaly.

---

#### Executive Forgery
*2nd-level Transmutation*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 minute
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 24 hours 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a scrap of real handwriting)

You forge an official document, digital signature, or authorization key that appears legitimate to casual inspection. A creature inspecting it closely must make an Investigation check against your spell save DC to recognize it as fake.

---

#### Exhaustion Nullifier
*4th-level Abjuration*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a crushed caffeine capsule)

You instantly eliminate levels of Exhaustion, revitalizing the target’s physical and mental state.
 
- Removes 1 level of Exhaustion (2 levels if cast at 6th level or higher).
- If cast on an unconscious or overworked target, they regain 4d8 hit points in addition to exhaustion removal.

---

#### Exiled from the Self
*9th-level Enchantment*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Duration:** :: Permanent 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a mirror that has never reflected the caster)

You force a target to become a stranger to themselves.
 
- The target must make a Charisma saving throw (DC 20) or lose all memories of who they are, what they believe, and what they have done.
- They retain skills and knowledge but have no personal attachment to any of it.
- The effect can only be undone by tracing their past through physical records or using a Wish spell.

---

#### Existence Audit
*9th-level Divination*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 minute
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Duration:** :: Permanent 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a forensic reality ledger, bound in classified government seals)

The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they are retroactively erased from history—no records, memories, or traces of their existence remain. Their equipment, personal effects, and any impacts they made on reality remain, but they are gone from time itself.

**Anomaly Effect:**
 >- The caster gains the Unstable condition
 >- Casting this spell draws the attention of an entity known as “The Auditor.” Within 1d6 weeks, a paranormal force investigates whether the spell was justified. If not, it may attempt to restore the erased target—or worse, erase the caster in return.

---

#### Existence Redacted
*9th-level Abjuration*
*Wizard, Cleric*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a blank, untouched book)

You invoke an ultimate bureaucratic decree, striking a being from the known fabric of reality. Choose one creature within range. It must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it takes 20d12 impact damage, and its name, face, and presence are erased from all documents and memories of those who fail a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw.
 
 On a success, it takes half damage and remains in existence.

**Blood Pact:** True Name Etching

---

#### Existential Debt
*5th-level Enchantment*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 hour 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a signed contract infused with a drop of the target’s blood)

You impose an unavoidable debt upon the target, compelling them to fulfill an obligation tied to their very being.
 
 The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure:
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
 
- They become existentially bound to the caster, compelled to follow one command that does not directly endanger their life.
- If they resist the obligation, they suffer 2d10 cognitive damage at the start of each of their turns.
- If the target dies while under this spell, their soul is held in escrow, awaiting transfer.
 
 The debt can be transferred to another willing entity via a ritual requiring 10 minutes and a secondary Charisma saving throw.

---

#### Expired Authority
*Cantrip Enchantment*
*Bard, Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 round 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

For a fleeting moment, a creature within range instinctively hesitates, doubting its own authority. If the target is attempting to enforce a rule, issue a command, or exert influence over another creature, it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or momentarily second-guess itself, delaying its action until the start of its next turn.

---

#### Eyes Behind the Kiss
*2nd-level Necromancy*
*Bard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Special 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

The caster places a lingering, whispering kiss upon the target, sapping their very essence.
 
- The target loses 2d4 Strength for 24 hours, their muscles wilting as if touched by decay.
- For 1d10 turns, the target is completely helpless, collapsing under an unseen weight, as if an entity watches from behind their eyes.
- If the target is already affected by a Necromancy spell, it takes extra 1d6 chiaric damage at the start of its next turn.
 
 Those struck by this curse claim to see their own reflection smile at them, long after the caster has left.

---

#### Fabricated Memory
*Cantrip Divination*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 5 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

By momentarily altering a minor cognitive detail, you cause a creature to misremember something trivial. It might forget setting its keys down, misplace an item it was just holding, or recall an insignificant interaction that never happened. The effect is fleeting, lasting only a few seconds before the mind corrects itself.

#### Faint Heartbeat
*Cantrip Necromancy*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

You attune your senses to the fading echoes of life. You become aware of the heartbeat of any creature within range, even if they are hidden or invisible, as long as they are not undead or a construct. You do not learn their exact location, only their presence.

#### Famine Birth
*3rd-level Necromancy*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Until the anomaly resolves itself 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a shard of cracked bone, buried in the target’s flesh)

You press your fingers against the target’s abdomen and whisper an incantation that only hunger understands. The body responds, but not in the way it should. Something takes root within the target’s form, but it is not life—it is absence made flesh.
 
- The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure:
- They become host to an Unborn Hunger, a parasitic void that feeds upon them instead of growing.
- Each long rest, they lose 1d4 maximum hit points, their flesh pulling taut over their bones.
- Their appetite vanishes—no matter what they eat, their body refuses to digest it.
- They can feel it moving inside them, shifting with breath, curling beneath the ribs.
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
- If reduced to 0 HP while afflicted, they do not die. Instead, their body becomes an empty husk, and something else uses their form.
 
 Ending the Spell:
- If the host wishes to remove it, they must cut it out manually, taking 4d6 tearing damage and making a DC 15 Constitution check to remain conscious.
- A failed removal attempt may cause the entity to take full control, wearing the host like a suit of skin.

**Anomaly Effect:**
- If multiple creatures are afflicted at once, they begin to crave each other, drawn together by an instinct to consume the unborn within one another.

#### Fascination
*Cantrip Enchantment*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 12 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a biometric signature of the target)

A subdermal neurological impulse is implanted in the target’s cognitive prioritization center, making them incapable of focusing on anything but the caster.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save:

- The affected target follows the caster wherever they go, unable to take their eyes off them.
- If attacked, the target enters a berserk fury, attacking anyone who obstructs their pursuit of the caster (+1 to hit, -1 AC).
- The target may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

#### Faulty Wiring
*Cantrip Evocation*
*Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Material (a frayed copper wire)

You send a small jolt of paranormal static into an electronic device or light source. A radio emits garbled voices, a neon sign flickers erratically, or a speaker lets out a burst of unintelligible noise. If cast on a security camera, it glitches for one round, distorting any footage.

---

#### Fauxshock
*2nd-level Evocation*
*Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

You designate a point on the ground within range. Instantly, a 20-foot-radius circle of artificial, plasticky turf unfurls across the terrain, complete with unnatural green coloring, chemical smell, and the vague scent of childhood disappointment.- When the field appears, all creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 electric damage as an electrical charge surges through the plastic blades.- For the duration, the turf remains charged. The first time each creature enters or starts its turn on the turf, it must make another Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 electric damage and suffer static shock-induced disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll or ability check it makes before the end of its next turn.- The grass is obviously unnatural and makes loud squeaking sounds when stepped on. It is difficult terrain for creatures wearing metal armor.

The turf remains permanently after the spell ends, though it loses its electrical charge.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d6 per slot level above 2nd, and the radius increases by 5 feet.

A warning to future generations: do not attempt to mow it. The mower will catch fire.*

#### Feeblemime
*3rd-level Necromancy*
*Druid, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 ft.
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

The target is cursed to act out everything they say. No new effects. The target must make a Charisma saving throw or be unable to communicate normally for 1 minute. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or suffer the curse's effects for 1 minute. Security footage from the black site shows an entire research team miming silently in unison for three hours. No audio recorded. The final frames show them turning toward the camera, mouths moving—but no sound was ever heard. Additional Effects: No new effects No new effects

#### Festering Graze
*3rd-level Enchantment*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Permanent until cured 
**Components:** :: Somatic 

A touch laced with the essence of decay invades the target’s body, unseen and insidious. The rot festers quietly beneath the surface, waiting to unravel its host.- The target becomes infected with a random disease that is linked to the natural decay of the body. This affliction is dormant for three days, during which the target feels no ill effects.- After three days, the disease awakens. Symptoms manifest suddenly, accompanied by whispers of secrets and memories of decay that take hold of the target’s mind. Feverish visions and murmured words plague the afflicted, distorting their perception of reality.- A successful Medicine check reveals nothing unusual at first glance. The symptoms appear natural, as though the disease were always meant to be a part of the target’s life. No magical traces of the rot can be detected without specialized magic or knowledge.

Effect:
While the disease is dormant, the target remains unaware of the affliction. Upon the disease’s awakening, they suffer from both physical and psychological effects, with hallucinations and fever overtaking them. The whispers may speak of forgotten memories, lost opportunities, or cryptic warnings—each whisper an unsettling reflection of the decay inside them.

The disease is not immediately fatal but can lead to a slow decline in health, eventually debilitating the target unless it is cured. Cure Disease or similar magical healing can remove the affliction.

#### Filing Error
*Cantrip Illusion*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 round 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

For an instant, a piece of paper, card, or document within range appears misfiled, smudged, or incorrectly labeled. Any creature attempting to reference it must make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to notice the anomaly. The effect fades once examined closely.

---

#### Final Expense Reimbursement
*9th-level Necromancy*
*Cleric*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a signed resurrection contract)

You restore one creature to life, no matter how long they’ve been dead, provided a contract with a binding entity exists to authorize their return. If no contract exists, the spell fails.

#### Fire Colt
*2nd-level Conjuration*
*Paladin, Ranger, Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

You summon a tiny, fiery equine construct—a blazing colt no larger than a medium-sized dog. It snorts embers, kicks up sparks, and serves as both a mount and a living incendiary hazard.

The horse has the following traits:

AC: 14
HP: 20
Speed: 40 ft.
Resistance: Pyric
Size: Small
Ridable by Medium or smaller creatures

Abilities:
- Flaming Charge: As a bonus action, the colt can charge a creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 pyric damage and be pushed 5 feet.
- Explosive Dismissal: When the spell ends (whether voluntarily or involuntarily), the colt explodes in a 10-foot radius. Creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 pyric damage, or half on a success.

Unstable Nature:

At the start of each of your turns, roll a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the colt becomes unstable and explodes immediately, ending the spell.

The Fire Colt was the unintended side effect of a thaumaturgic containment breach in Lab 4B. Personnel exposed to its presence for over five minutes reported flickering memory gaps and the sensation that the colt had “always been there.” It trots in loops when bored.*

#### First Act Entrée
*3rd-level Divination*
*Bard, Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 ft.
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

Your eyes blaze with unrelenting presence, demanding the spotlight from all who meet your gaze. You become the center of the narrative—whether admired, feared, or hated.

Choose any number of creatures within range who can see you. Each must make a Charisma saving throw.- On a failure, the creature becomes overwhelmed by your presence:- It has disadvantage on attack rolls against anyone but you.- It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns or use its action to dramatically comment on you aloud—either praising, mocking, or expressing obsession.- It cannot benefit from being invisible or unseen while affected.- On a success, the creature resists the effect but still feels mildly unnerved, suffering disadvantage on Charisma (Deception) checks against you for the duration.

At Higher Levels.
When cast using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the spell affects creatures who cannot see you, as long as they are within range and have heard your name or seen your likeness in the past 24 hours.

#### First Responder Algorithm
*2nd-level Abjuration*
*Cleric*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a biometric scanner or a health diagnostic device)

Algorithmic stabilizers were originally created for high-risk black site personnel. However, overuse led to cases of “looping awareness reflex”—a condition where revived individuals reported dying multiple times simultaneously.*

---

#### Flashbang
*3rd-level Evocation*
*Ranger*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Duration:** :: up to 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

You toss an arcane flashbang at a point within range, briefly stunning foes. Creatures in a 15-foot radius must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded and deafened until the end of your next turn.

---

#### Flawless Diamond of Dread
*7th-level Evocation*
*Cleric, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 Bonus Action
**Range:**        :: 20 ft
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Material (a wooden coin)

You lift a wooden coin between two fingers, and for a moment it refracts light like a perfect diamond. Then it cracks—soundlessly—and the world flinches. A prismatic spike of psychic light erupts from your palm, targeting one creature within range.

The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 9d8 chiaric damage, their soul briefly exposed to the void between form and perception. On a success, they take half damage.

While the damage is instant, the wound is not:  
- If the creature survives, their shadow refuses to follow their movements for 1 hour.  
- Affected creatures cannot be healed by magical means until the start of your next turn.  
- If this spell reduces a creature to 0 HP, they vanish silently—no body, no mark, only a lingering echo of their name.
- The target cannot be hidden from magical detection (such as *Ghost Circuit* or *Giocrin’s Hunt*).  
- If they speak, their voice echoes unnaturally, revealing their position to any creature within 60 feet.

For 1 minute after taking damage from this spell, the target becomes crystalline within. Whenever they take radiation, cognitive, or chiaric damage, roll a d4. On a 1, the damage is reflected onto a random creature within 10 feet instead, as internal refractions lash outward unpredictably.

Fracture Point: If the creature is reduced to 0 hit points by this spell, they break into dust-fine crystal, leaving behind only a single perfect diamond worth 100 credit (tainted with residual dread).

At the end of the duration, the crystals dissolve harmlessly, leaving only lingering static in their nervous system.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher: Reality trembles slightly, causing a ripple that lingers unseen.

During the Calamity of Shrouded Stars, Flawless Diamond of Dread was unleashed upon a battlefield, reducing an entire legion to nameless husks. Those who survived swore they heard their own names whispered by the void.

#### Flesh to Paper
*8th-level Transmutation*
*Wizard, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Permanent 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (A page torn from an ancient book)

Something unknown has touched this magic, leaving behind traces of those who have cast it before.

Before the disaster at Hollowwatch, scribes documented the sudden, inexplicable disappearance of a scholar who had been researching Flesh to Paper. The books on his desk were found neatly stacked, except for one—a tome that had no title, and no pages inside.

Ancient tablets unearthed beneath the ruins of Gilded Hollow show early inscriptions of Flesh to Paper, yet none can determine the language it was written in. The characters shift when no one is looking.

You rewrite a creature’s very being. They must make a Constitution saving throw or be transformed into a parchment scroll, trapped in written form until the scroll is burned.

At 9th level, you may choose to inscribe their mind into a book instead, preserving their thoughts.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher: Reality trembles slightly, causing a ripple that lingers unseen.

**Blood Pact:** True Name Etching

#### Fleshsmith’s Alloy
*5th-level Transmutation*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 hour
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Permanent 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a severed limb, still warm)

You heat iron, steel, or bone, mixing it with living flesh, forging them together into a hybrid alloy that feels both warm and cold to the touch.
 
- This does not create a living creature—it creates an object that remembers pain, warmth, and hunger.
- Flesh-infused metal moves slightly when held, adjusting to its wielder’s grip.
- If used in armor, it twitches and flexes on impact, slightly reducing damage.
- If used in a weapon, it drinks the blood it spills, remaining polished even after battle.
- If destroyed, the material screams.

**Anomaly Effect:**
- If multiple pieces of flesh-forged metal are stored together, they may merge into something else, something that resents its creation.

#### Flickering Veil
*Cantrip Illusion*
*Wizard, Sorcerer*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Somatic 

You momentarily distort your presence, causing your form to flicker like a mirage. Until the start of your next turn, attack rolls against you have disadvantage if the attacker relies on sight. If you move on your turn, you leave behind a faint afterimage that vanishes after 1 round.

---

#### Fold Space
*4th-level Transmutation*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: 10 minutes
**Range:**        :: 100 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 hour 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a reflective shard of warped glass)

You create a temporary shortcut between two points, linking two doorways, hallways, or urban streets within 100 feet.
 
- Walking into one entrance instantly exits through the other.
- The fold collapses if detected by corporate security measures.
- Once the spell ends, the passage vanishes without a trace.

#### Forgotten Banquet of Determination
*2nd-level Necromancy*
*Sorcerer, Wizard, Paladin, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: 10 minutes
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
**Range:**        :: 60 ft
**Duration:** :: 24h 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Material (a saltbush twig)

You conjure a long, spectral table adorned with silverware, flickering candles, and translucent dishes steaming with ghostly food. The banquet is silent. No scent wafts from the platters. The air is cold, and time feels strangely still.

Up to 12 creatures of your choice within range may partake. Each creature that consumes the food must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw as spectral flavors and ancestral memories fill their senses.- On a success: The meal steels their resolve. They gain +3 bonus to AC and become immune to the charmed condition for 24 hours.- On a failure: The feast is too much to endure. They gain 1 level of exhaustion, as ghostly voices whisper forgotten griefs into their ears.- Regardless of the outcome, the meal nourishes the creature completely, removing hunger for the next 24 hours.

Once the meal is consumed, the banquet slowly fades, and only a ring of salt and ash remains where the table stood.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher:
One of the empty chairs pulls itself out, as if seating someone unseen. For the next 24 hours, the caster hears faint cutlery clinking behind them when alone.

The phantom ship *Elder’s Lament* was last seen adrift in the Void Sea, its captain having invoked Forgotten Banquet of Determination in a desperate bid to escape the Hunt. The ship is still seen, sometimes, but never in the same place twice.
> 
> The very air around Forgotten Banquet of Determination seems to recoil, as if reality itself wishes to avoid acknowledging its existence. It is a spell that should not be, yet is.*

#### Fragmentation Rift
*8th-level Conjuration*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 150 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a shard of broken glass)

You summon a dimensional rift in an unoccupied space you can see. Any creature within 20 feet of the rift must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 14d10 impact damage as the very fabric of reality slices through them. On a success, they take half damage.
 
 Any creature reduced to 0 HP by this spell is torn from reality, their fate unknown. The rift collapses at the end of your next turn.

---

#### Ghost Broadcast
*2nd-level Illusion*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: 10 minutes
**Range:**        :: 1 mile
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a cracked radio speaker)

You project an illusionary transmission onto any available public or private communication channel, allowing you to send pre-recorded misinformation, propaganda, or encrypted signals.
 
- The message appears real to all who hear it, unless they succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check DC 15.
- Corporate networks attempt to trace the signal, but the source remains undetectable unless hacked.

---

#### Ghost Circuit
*2nd-level Illusion*
*Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 1 hour 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

You slip between digital signals, cloaking your presence from the eyes of modern surveillance. While the spell is active, the target becomes invisible to all forms of electronic detection, including:

- Security cameras  
- Biometric scans  
- Motion sensors  
- Augmented optics  
- Automated surveillance drones  

Any digital recording device attempting to observe the target displays static, blank footage, looping segments, or null reads. Creatures relying on standard, unaided senses can still see and interact with the target as normal.

If the affected creature directly interacts with an electronic device (e.g., hacking a terminal or opening a scanned door), the system may register anomalies or error codes but not the user's identity.

#### Ghost ID
*3rd-level Illusion*
*Wizard, Bard*
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

**Casting Time:** :: 10 minutes
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 24 hours 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a stolen employee badge)

You overlay a false bureaucratic identity onto a creature, making them appear as a registered employee, citizen, or authorized visitor.
 
- Corporate databases, biometric scanners, and ID checks recognize the target as legitimate.
- The illusion does not hold up under direct questioning—NPCs may notice inconsistencies if the target acts suspiciously.

---

#### Ghost Signal
*3rd-level Transmutation*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

You become a phantom in the system. Your body glitches between states, causing the following effects:
- You can move through crowds undetected unless someone is actively looking for you.

- You can phase through glass, chain-link fences, or doors that are not reinforced.
- You are immune to pressure-sensitive floors, security scans, and motion detectors.

---

#### Ghost Slap
*Cantrip Necromancy*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

A haptic force field momentarily materializes, delivering a sharp, percussive impact to a target. The sensation is startling but harmless, designed to elicit attention, dominance, or playful reprimand.
 
- If the target fails a Wisdom saving throw, they experience a moment of flustered distraction, causing disadvantage on their next attack roll or ability check.
- If the target is affected by Ghost Slap, it has disadvantage on the next saving throw against a Necromancy spell cast before the end of your next turn.
- Frequently used in advanced social dominance training protocols and high-end recreational services.

#### Giocrin's Face of Rust
*2nd-level Necromancy*
*Cleric, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self Cone/20 ft
**Duration:** :: nan 
**Components:** :: Somatic 

You release a conical wave of decaying shadow that unravels matter and memory. Each creature in a 20-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 chiaric damage and cannot regain hit points until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and suffers no additional effects.

When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher, reality trembles—a barely perceptible ripple distorts the air, leaving behind a faint trace of something watching. This has no mechanical effect, but those attuned to anomalies may notice.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher, reality trembles—a barely perceptible ripple distorts the air, leaving behind a faint trace of something watching. This has no mechanical effect, but those attuned to anomalies may notice.

Giocrin’s Face of Rust is banned in Concord. The spell is infamous after a member of the Silent Maw cult used it to unmake a senator in broad daylight. Witnesses claimed the victim’s shadow screamed before vanishing, leaving only the echo of a face rusted into the stone beneath.
> 
> Casters of this spell often report strange dreams afterward—corridors without end, mirrored doors, and rusted locks clicking open in their sleep. Some claim the spell remembers everyone who has ever used it.*

#### Giocrin's Hunt
*4th-level Divination*
*Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 ft Line/10 ft
**Duration:** :: nan 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (snowberry leaves and bread crumbs)

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
You cast out a burst of twisted awareness—the echo of something watching, something ancient and analytical. The air in the chosen area distorts, revealing the ghostly attention trails of an otherworldly intelligence.

All creatures of your choice within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they suffer the effects listed below:

On a success, the creature is unaffected, but leaves behind a faint trail visible only to you, allowing you to track them regardless of stealth or invisibility.

At Higher Levels.
When cast with a 5th-level spell slot or higher:- Affected creatures also become Frightened of you for 1 round on a failed save.- You may choose up to twice as many creatures to be affected.

| Effect         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Marked     | The creature emits a visible, flickering aura only you can see. You have advantage on attack rolls, ability checks to track, locate, or affect them. |
| Haunted    | The creature is Under Surveillance (custom condition): has disadvantage on Stealth checks and cannot benefit from invisibility. |
| Overloaded | If the creature is already being observed by magical or technological surveillance, it takes 4d6 cognitive damage from conflicting signals. |

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher:
A shimmering eye blinks open in the air and follows your gaze. It remains for 1 round, granting you truesight in the affected area during that time.

The rogue artificer Veyl Renshaw designed an enchanted device that could replicate Giocrin's Hunt. She activated it only once—her house was later found standing, but all its doors opened into an endless void.
> 
> To cast Giocrin's Hunt is to invite a presence that does not belong. The words taste of static, the gestures feel like echoes of hands not your own.*

#### Giocrin's Incantation of Bitterness
*7th-level Transmutation*
*Sorcerer, Wizard, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Premanent (until removed) 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

You whisper an ancient syllable not meant to be spoken—a fractured word dredged from beneath time itself. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be branded by a lingering metaphysical wound.

- The target becomes vulnerable to either tearing or impact damage (your choice). This vulnerability cannot be removed by ordinary means.
- While affected, any time the target takes damage from the chosen type, they must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.
- If the target reaches 3 levels of exhaustion in this way, the damage type reverberates within their soul: all resistances to that damage type are lost permanently, and they are always considered flanked, even when not surrounded.

The curse is subtle at first. The skin bruises too easily. The bone aches before it breaks. Eventually, even the lightest touch feels like betrayal.

This effect lasts until removed by powerful means such as *Memory Banishment Protocol*, *Vestigial Extraction*, or an A.S.T.R.A.L. anomaly purge.

**Anomaly Effect:**
Reality trembles slightly, causing a ripple that lingers unseen. For 1 minute, any creature within 60 feet that speaks hears its words echoed in reverse, as if remembered before they were spoken.

Legend says that Giocrin's Incantation of Bitterness was first cast by the exiled wizard Iosephine Blackquill, who sought to trap a god within a single word. The spell succeeded—but the god did not remain silent for long.
> 
> The ancients who first uttered Giocrin's Incantation of Bitterness did not record its effects, only their warnings: 'It does not unmake. It remembers. And it will remember you, too.'*

#### Giocrin's Nostalgia
*1st-level Evocation*
*Sorcerer, Wizard, Paladin, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: nan 
**Components:** :: Verbal 

You conjure a strange arcane light tied to memory, place, and presence. When casting, choose one of the following:- Beacon – A soft, haunting light forms at your feet or a space within reach, shedding bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The beacon remains stationary for 30 minutes, unaffected by wind or water.- Flare – You launch a sudden pulse of colored light straight upward, visible for miles if outdoors. The flare lasts 1 round, providing bright light in a 60-foot radius around its apex before fading instantly.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
The light can be any color you choose, and is eerie but not blinding—it does not impair vision or deal damage.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When you cast this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher, the light flickers in an unnatural rhythm. Roll a d6:- 5–6: The light reveals something that was never meant to be seen—a shadow with no source, a door where none should be, or a half-formed memory pressing through reality. This has no mechanical effect, but may provoke an encounter, whisper insight, or alter a future decision (at the DM’s discretion).

Giocrin wandered into forgotten places with a lantern that burned brighter in regret than in darkness. When he vanished, only the flame remained—flickering in places he might have walked, but never did.
> 
> The last known caster, Darsil Veil, was found dead beside his burned-out focus. His eyes were empty. His notes described “the whispering ones” and warned: “Some light doesn’t show where we are—it shows what we’ve lost.”
> 
> Some believe this spell doesn’t just illuminate—it invites observation from elsewhere.*

*Cantrip Abjuration*
*Sorcerer, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 reaction, which you take when an enemy rolls a critical hit against you
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

As your attacker lands a devastating blow, your form momentarily fractures like glass. The critical hit is reduced to a normal hit, but you take an additional 1d4 cognitive damage from the strain.

At higher levels (5th, 11th, and 17th level), the cognitive damage increases by 1d4.

#### Glitch Step
*Cantrip Divination*
*Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: Instant 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Terrain 
**Terrain:** :: Flickering Digital Surface

With a sudden shift in perception, you instinctively navigate the reality around you, stepping through the digital distortion of space.- Effect:- You teleport up to 5 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.- The movement is instantaneous and silent, as if the very architecture of the world is bending around you.- This effect can be used to bypass difficult terrain or to avoid attacks of opportunity, but only for the distance specified.

At Higher Levels:- 5th Level: You can teleport up to 10 feet.- 11th Level: You can teleport up to 15 feet, and you can teleport through obstacles like thin walls or doors that are not solid.

As your foot leaves the ground, the world around you briefly flickers, as if a digital surface has been hacked. For an instant, the space around you glitches, and you are teleported to a new position, slipping through the cracks of reality itself. You reappear with an eerie, unnatural smoothness, like a bug in a program.*

#### Glossolalia Error
*1st-level Enchantment*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 reaction (when a creature within range speaks or casts a spell)
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 round 
**Components:** :: Verbal 

A burst of anomalous interference disrupts speech and incantations. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be silenced until the end of their next turn. If they were casting a spell, they must make a Concentration check or the spell fails.

#### Gluttonous Maw
*3rd-level Conjuration*
*Warlock, Sorcerer*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet 10-foot radius
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (A blackened tooth)

You tear a wound in reality, and from the rip emerges a swirling vortex of translucent gums and spectral teeth, chattering hungrily in the void. The maw floats inches above the ground, grinding with maddening rhythm as it devours sound, light, and matter.

When the spell is cast, and again at the start of each of your turns, all creatures of your choice in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw.- On a failure, they take 4d8 impact damage and are pulled 5 feet toward the center of the maw.- On a success, they take half damage and are not pulled.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
Creatures reduced to 0 HP by this spell do not fall unconscious—they vanish with a wet snap, erased from reality until the spell ends. When it does, they reappear prone and unconscious in the center of the area unless they were stabilized or healed elsewhere.

The maw is difficult terrain, and non-magical ranged attacks that pass through it automatically miss due to the warping of space and air pressure.

At Higher Levels.- 5th level or higher: The area increases to a 15-foot radius, and damage increases by 1d8 per level beyond 3rd.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher: Reality trembles slightly, causing a ripple that lingers unseen.

**Blood Pact:** Faded Beauty

> A beggar on the streets of Concord claims to have been a king before uttering the words of Gluttonous Maw. When asked for details, his mouth moves, but no sound emerges.
> 
> Some claim that Gluttonous Maw does not work the same way twice. The more one casts it, the more it adapts—learning, watching, waiting.*

#### Gourds and Wharfs
*1st-level Conjuration*
*Bard, Druid, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 ft
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Material, Verbal (a pumpkin seed or small piece of driftwood)

You summon a whimsical assortment of decorative gourds accompanied by a miniature wooden dock at a point within range. The purpose of this spell is unclear, lost to time, yet oddly charming.

Roll a d6 to determine the precise effect:

At Higher Levels (Scaling):
When cast using a higher-level spell slot, the conjured objects become larger and potentially more practical:

Spell Slot Level
Enhanced Effect
2nd-level
The dock or gourds are large enough to serve as half-cover.
3rd-level
You summon an actual wooden pier segment or a large pumpkin capable of sheltering one medium-sized creature.
4th-level or higher
You conjure a fully functional pier and rowboat, or an enormous pumpkin capable of sheltering several creatures comfortably.

| d6 | Summon Result                                                                 |
|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | A harmless pile of decorative gourds appears.                                |
| 2  | Gourds appear and burst into harmless, colorful sparks.                      |
| 3  | A small wooden dock appears precisely 10 feet away from the target point.    |
| 4  | A small wooden dock appears with a tiny boat gently bobbing at its side.     |
| 5  | A talking scarecrow briefly appears, makes an obscure remark, and vanishes.  |
| 6  | A single, massive pumpkin (large enough to provide half-cover) appears.      |

A partially burned A.S.T.R.A.L. manuscript mentions a long-abandoned festival involving pumpkins, piers, and confusing folk traditions. The context is lost, leaving only playful chaos.*

#### Grasp of the Unseen
*Cantrip Conjuration*
*Wizard, Sorcerer*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 round 
**Components:** :: Somatic 

A spectral, invisible hand momentarily grips an object or creature within range.

- If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.
- If the target is an unattended object, you can pull it 10 feet toward you or away from you.

The hand disappears immediately after the effect occurs.

#### Grubby Learn-Fists
*1st-level Abjuration*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: self
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

Your hands are suddenly overcome with a thirst for knowledge. They twitch with magical awareness and autonomously seek out tools, books, and unfamiliar objects with unsettling eagerness.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
For the duration, your hands gain proficiency with one tool, weapon, or instrument of your choice. If you are already proficient, you instead gain advantage on ability checks using that item.

At the start of each of your turns, make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 10). On a failure, your hands act independently for that round. They might:
- Grab random items
- Gesture wildly
- Drop what you’re holding
- Or attempt to use the new skill without your consent (DM’s choice)

If cast using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you may gain one additional proficiency per level above 1st (your hands learn more—but also grow harder to control).

If cast using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you may gain one additional proficiency per level above 1st (your hands learn more—but also grow harder to control).

The spell was banned from several universities after a scroll archive was completely ransacked by enchanted fingers.*

#### Gutterwake
*Cantrip Transmutation*
*Sorcerer*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 15 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

You awaken the filth of the streets. Puddles ripple, dust rises, and refuse shifts unnaturally in a 15-foot cone originating from you. Creatures within range must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be briefly disoriented by the sudden movement, causing them to have disadvantage on the next opportunity attack they make before the end of their next turn. If cast in an area with significant debris or liquid, you can instead create a fleeting image or pattern in the grime, which lasts for 1 minute.

---

#### Halo Brand
*1st-level Enchantment*
*Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Bonus Action
**Range:**        :: 30 ft
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal 

Mark a target with a visible or invisible halo of sanctity or corruption (your choice). The target is affected based on the surrounding terrain:- On Sanctified Ground, they take an additional 1d4 chiaric damage from melee attacks.- On Desecrated Ground, they deal -1 damage with all attacks, and their spells have -1 spell attack.

If the terrain is not consecrated/corrupted, the effect does nothing—but casting Consecrate or Corrupt while this spell is active activates its effects immediately.

#### Heartbreaker
*9th-level Necromancy*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Duration:** :: Permanent 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

You speak a single phrase—a word whispered directly into the soul. The target alone hears it. A secret so unbearable, so cosmically cruel, that their body betrays them in its attempt to cope.- The target must make a Constitution saving throw.- On a failure, their heart seizes violently, and they instantly die. Their body remains intact, but their life cannot be restored by any means short of a Wish.- On a success, the target is left paralyzed for 1d6 + 6 weeks, gasping and broken. They cannot take actions, move, or speak for the duration.- Regardless of outcome, the target permanently suffers –1 Strength and –1 Constitution.

**Blood Pact:** True Name Etching, (Optional) If the caster speaks the true name of the target as part of the spell, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw. This use is rare and dangerous, and permanently marks the caster’s aura with a traceable curse.

Some believe the word is not magic, but a truth—a terrible, ancient syllable buried beneath existence. It cannot be remembered, but once spoken, its echo never fades.*

#### Heat Void
*2nd-level Transmutation*
*Wizard, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch (1 forge, anvil, or crafting station)
**Duration:** :: 1 hour 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a coal that has never burned)

You channel an ancient thermal anomaly into a modern workspace—be it a forge, workshop, or urban fabrication station. The air hums silently, and metal tools quiver unnaturally as the void-heat replaces all natural flame.

While active, the workspace becomes suffused with an invisible, willful heat that alters material behavior:
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
- Metals become pliable by hand, able to be reshaped or fused without tools—however, if the intended design contradicts some unknown property of the metal, it violently rejects reshaping (DM's discretion, may cause backlash).
- Electronics overheat without smoke or failure, entering a dormant "flicker" state where signals become erratic or unpredictable.
- Synthetic materials fuse or warp, producing hybrid composites with anomalous properties (e.g., rubber-steel, memory plastic with bone-like texture).
- Bone, ivory, or ceramic embedded in the field becomes magnetized to nearby metal, creating eerie pseudo-biotech components.
- Anything crafted or altered under the void-heat retains warmth for 72 hours and radiates a low hum in radio frequencies.

While under this effect:
- Smiths gain advantage on crafting checks involving metal, bone, or composite materials.
- Crafted items may gain anomalous traits at the GM’s discretion (e.g., whispering edges, resistance to mundane corrosion, mild telepathic signature).

**Anomaly Effect:**
Overuse may alter the workstation itself. Vents weep mercury, engines resist standard inputs, and tools develop unexpected curvatures. A successful DC 17 Arcana or Engineering check halts the corruption—for now.

#### Hemograft Steel
*3rd-level Transmutation*
*Bard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 50 ft.
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal, Material (a non-magical weapon with a blade or point, which is destroyed upon casting)

You perform a violent arcane gesture and speak a phrase in reversed syntax, launching a weapon directly into a creature’s body as if administering a twisted injection. The weapon disintegrates mid-flight and rematerializes inside the target.- Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 6d6 tearing damage and the weapon is embedded into their body.- Lingering Pain: As long as the weapon remains inside them, the target takes 1d4 tearing damage each time they take an action, bonus action, or move more than 5 feet.- Removing the Weapon: A creature may attempt to remove the weapon as an action. This requires a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the weapon is wrenched free, dealing 3d6 bleeding damage, and the target must immediately succeed on a DC 13 Medicine check or begin bleeding uncontrollably—taking 1d4 damage at the start of each of their turns until stabilized.- The weapon vanishes into ash if the spell is dispelled, the target becomes unconscious, or the spell ends by other magical means.- The original weapon used as the material component is destroyed as part of the casting.

#### Hesitation Protocol
*Cantrip Abjuration*
*Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 reaction, which you take when a creature targets you with an attack
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

An unseen force invokes bureaucratic inertia, subtly clouding a creature’s resolve. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it briefly questions its course of action, subtracting 1d4 from its attack roll.

---

#### Hollow Gaze
*Cantrip Necromancy*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 15 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 round 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

Your eyes darken as you channel a sliver of the void’s presence. One creature of your choice within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or feel an unnatural chill creeping over them. Until the start of your next turn, the creature has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks, and if it is concentrating on a spell, it must make a concentration check against your spell save DC.

---

#### Hollow Stare
*Cantrip Enchantment*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

Your gaze locks onto a creature, unnervingly hollow, as though reality has forgotten how to render your features.
 
- The target makes a Charisma saving throw.
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
- On a failure, they experience a momentary existential lapse, losing 1d4 Intelligence (minimum 1) until the end of their next turn.
- If they fail by 5 or more, their next spoken sentence is misheard by all creatures except the caster, as if reality "mistranscribed" it.

**Anomaly Effect:**
- If the target fails by 10 or more, a random piece of their personal history erases itself from reality, leaving a lingering feeling of unease but no memory of what was lost.

#### Hydrodynamic Lubrication Dispersal
*3rd-level Transmutation*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 1 foot
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes/level 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a drop of synthetic polymer)

This spell coats an organic surface with a self-replenishing, non-Newtonian lubricant, ensuring optimal fluid dynamics and friction reduction. The resulting material is sterile, hypoallergenic, and non-toxic, adhering to ASTRAL safety regulations.
 
- If cast on a surface, creatures must make a Dexterity saving throw or slip.
- If cast on a willing participant, it ensures seamless motion enhancement for the duration.
- A creature affected by an Enchantment spell must make their Dexterity save with disadvantage when stepping on the affected area.

 Used in luxury companionship services and enhanced biomechanical performance programs.

#### Immutable Clause
*3rd-level Transmutation*
*Bard, Wizard, Cleric*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Permanent (until nullified) 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a quill dipped in paradox ink)

With a whispered invocation, you impose absolute certainty upon an event, ensuring it cannot be undone, altered, or reversed by normal means.

- When cast, you declare one simple factual state affecting an object, person, or event. This fact becomes legally binding in the fabric of reality.
- Examples include:
- "This door was never locked."
- "She was always employed here."
- "This bullet did not hit me."
- The effect cannot be dispelled, countered, or challenged by ordinary magic.
- A court-level anomaly nullification hearing (or a 5th-level dispel magic cast in a place of corporate power) is required to break the clause.

**Anomaly Effect:**
 Anomaly Effect:
- If abused, the spell might accidentally add extra clauses, creating unintended loopholes.

#### Incantation of Viridian Determination
*7th-level Abjuration*
*Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self or Touch
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (honeysuckle root or an empty bottle)

You invoke a forgotten rite whispered only in the darkest forests of the world’s memory. Verdant energy coils around your body or that of a chosen creature, weaving an invisible knot of resolve that defies mortal limits. This knot pulses with an unnatural green glow, visible only in reflections and peripheral vision.

While under the effects of this spell, the creature gains the following benefits:

- Last Stand Ward: The next time the creature would fall to 0 hit points, they instead regain 3d10 + your spellcasting modifier hit points, immediately stand upright without using movement, and are immune to being reduced to 0 HP again until the end of their next turn. The spell then ends.
- Defiance of Death: Until the ward is triggered, the target cannot gain the *Unconscious* or *Paralysed* conditions.  
- Aura of Persistence: Allies within 10 feet gain advantage on saving throws against effects that would cause *Frightened*, *Paralysed*, or *Charmed*.

If the ward is not triggered within the spell’s duration, the energy fades—leaving behind a faint green sigil burned into the target’s aura, visible only to the dead.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher:  
A trail of green luminescence clings to the caster’s shadow for the next 24 hours. The shadow moves half a second out of sync, as though it remembers a version of you that no longer exists.

During the Calamity of Shrouded Stars, Incantation of Viridian Determination was unleashed upon a battlefield, reducing an entire legion to nameless husks. Those who survived swore they heard their own names whispered by the void.

#### Incident Response Extraction
*4th-level Transmutation*
*Wizard, Cleric*

**Casting Time:** :: 10 minutes
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Until triggered 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a personal tracking beacon)

You establish an emergency extraction point for a willing target. At any moment, the target may activate the extraction, teleporting instantly to a predetermined safe location within 1 mile.
 
- The spell only works once per casting.
- The extraction is flagged in corporate security logs, making repeated use of this spell riskier over time.

---

#### Induced Arousal
*1st-level Enchantment*
*Bard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 20 ft
**Duration:** :: 1 turn + 1 round/level 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a biometric stimulant patch)

You magically activate the target’s autonomic nervous system, forcing an intense physiological response. This includes rapid heartbeat, dilated pupils, flushed skin, heightened tactile sensitivity, and minor muscular tension. The effect is entirely physical and does not confer emotional intent or mental compulsion.

While affected, the creature has:
- Disadvantage on Stealth checks (too twitchy/sweaty)
- Advantage on checks involving heightened senses (Perception based on touch, taste, hearing)
- Disadvantage on concentration checks due to overstimulation
- Creatures immune to being charmed or who do not have nervous systems are unaffected.

Optional Roleplay Effects:

The response may resemble nervousness, excitement, or panic depending on context. Social misinterpretations are common and potentially useful (or disastrous).

Notes for Tables:
- Reflavor it for espionage, interrogation, or psychic interference if you want to avoid overtly sexual interpretation.
- Mechanically, it behaves like a stimulant-overload or magic caffeine shot — sensory boost, motor disruption.

#### Inkbound Familiar
*1st-level Conjuration*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 hour
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Permanent 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (special tattoo ink, certified and enchanted)
**Acquisition Note:** :: Requires ink certified by a mystic or black-market tattooist.

You etch a familiar into your skin as a living tattoo. The familiar takes the form of shifting ink etched into your skin and cannot leave your body or manifest physically. The familiar is alive in magical essence but exists only as a moving design on your flesh.

While the familiar is inkbound, you gain the following benefits:- You can see and hear through the familiar as long as it is on a visible part of your body (such as your arm, hand, or face). While using its senses, you are deaf and blind to your own surroundings.- You can communicate telepathically with the familiar while it remains tattooed on you and is conscious.- When you cast a spell with a range of touch, the familiar can deliver the spell through you if the body part bearing the tattoo is used to make contact with the target.- The familiar cannot attack, interact with objects, or move independently from your body. It can crawl across your skin, shifting its location and appearance, but it cannot leave your surface.- The tattoo cannot be removed by mundane means and persists even if you are polymorphed or disguised. If the tattoo is destroyed or erased by magical means (such as dispel magic or a targeted ritual), the familiar is banished and must be recreated by casting this spell again.

The familiar’s design changes subtly to reflect its emotions or magical stimuli, often revealing moods, warnings, or arcane patterns.

You can only have one inkbound familiar at a time. Attempting to cast this spell again causes the previous tattoo to fade and the familiar to vanish.

#### Insulated Surge
*Cantrip Abjuration*
*Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 1 round 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Terrain 
**Terrain:** :: Rubberized Flooring

The magical properties of rubberized flooring wrap around you, providing an insulating shield against electrical energy.- Effect:- For the duration of the spell, you gain resistance to electric damage, reducing any electric damage you take by half.- This resistance applies to any electric damage dealt to you from sources such as spells, traps, or environmental effects.

At Higher Levels:- 5th Level: The spell’s duration increases to 1 minute, allowing you to maintain the resistance for longer.- 11th Level: You gain advantage on saving throws against lightning-based effects while the spell is active.

The floor beneath you vibrates with a subtle hum as the air around you shimmers. With a swift motion, you tap into the insulating magic of the rubberized surface beneath, creating a protective barrier that shields you from incoming electric currents. The warmth of the shield pulses around you, and for the duration, any lightning strikes are absorbed by the magical field, leaving you unharmed.*

#### Irradiant Lance
*4th-level Evocation*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet 5 ft wide, 60 ft long line
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a small piece of radioactive isotopes)

You unleash a concentrated beam of unstable, pyric energy in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line.

- Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 6d8 pyric damage, or half as much on a success.  
- The beam burns a visible scar of irradiated energy across every surface it touches.

Radiation Effect:  
For as long as you maintain concentration, the scorched path emits low-level radiation:
- Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the irradiated scar takes 1d4 radiation damage.  
- If a creature receives any healing, magical or mundane, this damage no longer affects them unless they re-enter the area after being healed.

**Anomaly Effect:**
On a roll of 15 or higher while casting, the lance splits briefly at a 45-degree angle, creating a secondary irradiated scar that lasts for 1 round and deals half damage.

The beam doesn't stop at the body—it writes sickness into the air, the walls, the bones of the world.*

#### Jagged Step
*Cantrip Conjuration*
*Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 5ft
**Duration:** :: Instant 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Terrain 
**Terrain:** :: Broken Tiles

You propel a jagged shard of wood or stone from the ground beneath you, causing it to strike nearby enemies.- Effect:- You create a jagged splinter from the broken tiles or surrounding terrain, hurling it at a target within 5 feet of you.
- Each creature within 5 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 tearing damage from the jagged splinter.
- On a successful save, the creature takes half damage (round down).
- The spell also creates a minor dangerous terrain effect, causing any creatures in the affected area to take 1 point of tearing damage if they step within the 5-foot radius until the start of your next turn.

At Higher Levels:- 5th Level: The radius increases to 10 feet, and the damage increases to 2d6 tearing damage.- 11th Level: The spell’s radius increases to 15 feet, and the jagged splinters also cause creatures who fail the saving throw to be slowed (speed halved) until the end of their next turn.

You stomp your foot firmly on the cracked tiles, your body drawing on the surrounding debris, and with a sudden flick of your wrist, you summon the jagged shard of wood, rock, or broken tile to strike out at those nearby. The sharp splinter of the earth rattles, leaving a dangerous trail in its wake, and for a moment, the ground beneath you seems alive with jagged intent.*

#### Jealousy
*1st-level Enchantment*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 minute
**Range:**        :: 6 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
You release a subtle psychic disruption field that distorts emotional perception, planting the seed of envy and mistrust in the minds of nearby creatures.

Each creature in range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they become emotionally agitated, regarding nearby allies as rivals or threats to their own status or possessions.

While affected:
- They will argue, undermine, or accuse one another verbally, ignoring external threats unless harmed.
- If provoked (e.g., accused, mocked, slighted), they must make a Charisma saving throw or escalate to physical conflict.
- If a conflict becomes violent, roll 1d100. On a roll equal to or lower than your Intelligence modifier × 10, one creature lashes out with lethal intent.

The spell ends early if an affected creature takes damage from an external source or if you end concen

In social or investigative scenarios, this spell may cause suspicion, false confessions, or betrayal.

#### Keeper’s Sanctuary
*2nd-level Abjuration*
*Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10-foot radius
**Duration:** :: 10 Minutes 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal, Terrain (a ring of salt)

You create a Holy or Unholy ward centered on you. Choose one:- Holy: Enemies must make a Wisdom saving throw to enter. On failure, they are pushed 10 ft and cannot re-enter for 1 minute.- Unholy: Enemies entering take 1d6 necrotic damage and suffer disadvantage on saves vs fear and charm.

This does not count as a full Consecrate/Corrupt zone, but can bridge battlefield positioning and control.

#### Kiss of the Nereid
*8th-level Transmutation*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic 

The caster places a kiss upon the target’s lips, feeling their breath flutter like candlelight in the abyss.
 
- The target must make a Constitution saving throw (-2 penalty). On a failure, they drown instantly, as if submerged in unseen waters.
- Those who survive describe a vision of something immense, watching from beneath the surface.
- Those who fail leave behind no corpse, only a damp outline where they once stood.

 Some whisper that victims of this spell are not truly dead, but merely waiting… elsewhere.

#### Lantern of the Forgotten
*Cantrip Divination*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self (30-foot radius)
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

You conjure a spectral lantern hovering at your shoulder, flickering with an eerie, bluish glow. The lantern sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius, but only the caster and undead creatures can see it. If an undead creature enters the light, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or become unable to willingly move out of the light’s radius for 1 minute. A creature that succeeds on the save is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

---

#### Last Minute Optimization
*6th-level Transmutation*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 1 hour 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

The target’s body adjusts to its peak state. They gain +4 to their highest ability score (max 24) for the duration. However, one other random ability score is reduced by 4.

*Sorcerer*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 120 ft.
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Material, Somatic, Verbal (a key ring)

The caster instantly knows the exact location of their misplaced keys. Keep it as is. Unfortunately, this spell cannot retrieve them—it merely confirms they are somewhere deeply inconvenient.

*2nd-level Enchantment*
*Bard, Wizard, Ranger*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 1 minute

You align your movement signature with that of the last creature whose ID you possess. For the duration, security systems, biometric locks, and tracking software register you as that person.

#### Log
*Cantrip Conjuration*
*Bard, Druid, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 50 ft.
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal 

Creates a single, perfectly ordinary log within 50 feet of the caster. Despite its unremarkable appearance, the log radiates a strange aura of importance. Roll on the Log Essence Table to determine its wood type and subtle vibe.

The caster may sit on it, wield it as an improvised weapon (1d4 impact), or simply admire its pure log-ness.

#### Looming Obsidian of Anarchy
*7th-level Illusion*
*Cleric, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 ft
**Duration:** :: up to 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Somatic 

You conjure a monolithic shard of shadowed obsidian that floats, silent and watching, above the battlefield. Its presence is metaphysical—part hallucination, part intrusion from another plane. All who gaze upon it feel a pressure behind their eyes, as if something ancient is clawing through their thoughts.

Choose up to five creatures within range. Each must make an Intelligence saving throw at the start of each of their turns while the shard persists. On a failed save:

- The creature takes 6d6 cognitive damage.
- They suffer disadvantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks until the end of their next turn.
- If they fail by 5 or more, they also gain the Paranoid condition until the end of the spell.

On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and suffers no other effects that round.

The Obsidian Effect:  
At the end of each of your turns, the shard lashes out at a random creature of your choice within range that has already failed a saving throw this round. That creature immediately takes an additional 3d6 cognitive damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of their next turn.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher:  
The obsidian shard briefly reflects the face of someone long dead. All creatures who fail their saves this round hear their name spoken in a voice they should not recognize.

Before the disaster at Hollowwatch, scribes documented the sudden, inexplicable disappearance of a scholar who had been researching Looming Obsidian of Anarchy. The books on his desk were found neatly stacked, except for one—a tome that had no title, and no pages inside.
> 
> Ancient tablets unearthed beneath the ruins of Gilded Hollow show early inscriptions of Looming Obsidian of Anarchy, yet none can determine the language it was written in. The characters shift when no one is looking.*

#### Luhtin's Curious Footing
*1st-level Evocation*
*Cleric, Wizard, Paladin, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: nan 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
You imbue a creature you touch with a current of unstable, arcane energy. Until the spell ends, the target gains a hovering movement equal to its walking speed, allowing it to hover up to 3 feet above any solid or liquid surface.

This does not grant true flight and does not bypass obstacles like walls or ceilings. The creature can safely move across water, traps, pressure plates, caltrops, or other terrain hazards it hovers above.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When you cast this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher, reality ripples faintly, unnoticed by most. Arcane instruments may spike, or nearby liquids may rise slightly into the air for a moment before settling.

This has no mechanical effect but may attract the attention of a localized anomaly or trigger paranormal responses at the DM’s discretion.

The spell’s origin is lost to time, though fragments of it are inscribed on unstable crystal tablets found beneath Gilded Hollow. The characters change when unobserved, defying translation.
> 
> The scholar Luhtin Varr, last seen researching this spell at Hollowwatch, vanished without trace. His workspace was left in perfect order—except for a blank book, placed deliberately open on his desk.
> 
> Some believe the spell itself acts as a conduit—not just for energy, but for attention from elsewhere.
> 
> Casters often report a faint hum in their bones after using it—one that doesn’t always stop when the spell ends.*

#### Lurking Gloom
*Cantrip Illusion*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 round 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

You conjure a flicker of clinging darkness that momentarily lingers in the air. One creature of your choice within range must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or feel a wave of unnatural cold, reducing its passive Perception by 5 until the end of its next turn. If cast in dim light or darkness, the effect is automatically successful.

#### Mage Sand
*Cantrip Conjuration*
*Cleric*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: Permanent 
**Components:** :: Material, Verbal (A scrap of parchment with gibberish)

The caster conjures a small pile of golden sand in their palm. It has no magical properties but remains permanently damp. Scholars have debated its significance for centuries, yet it remains as pointless as ever. Additional Effects: nan

#### Magnetic Grip
*Cantrip Transmutation*
*Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 1 round 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Terrain 
**Terrain:** :: Steel Plates

Your feet become magnetized, securing you firmly to steel surfaces, providing enhanced stability against physical manipulation.- Effect:- You gain advantage on Strength saving throws and Strength (Athletics) checks to resist being shoved or knocked prone.- While the spell is active, you cannot be moved against your will by physical means unless the creature pushing you succeeds on a Strength (Athletics) check against your Strength saving throw DC.- The magnetic effect only works on steel or similarly magnetic surfaces (e.g., metal floors, steel grates, etc.).

At Higher Levels:- 5th Level: The spell grants advantage on all Dexterity saving throws to avoid falling prone or being knocked over by environmental hazards.- 11th Level: The spell lasts for 10 minutes, and the magnetism spreads to nearby metal objects, allowing you to pull or manipulate small metal items within 10 feet of you as part of the spell’s effect.

You feel the ground beneath you hum as the magic takes hold. A faint magnetic pull runs through the soles of your feet, anchoring you to the steel beneath you. You brace yourself, standing firm against the force trying to knock you over, as you become one with the steel underfoot. The pull grows stronger with every movement, keeping you solidly in place.*

#### Man ↔ Cock
*8th-level Transmutation*
*Druid, Sorcerer, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 ft
**Duration:** :: up to 10 minutes (or until dispelled) 
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal, Material (a rooster feather)

You perform a questionable and extremely localized reality shift, transforming a humanoid creature into a very aggressive rooster (or vice versa).
- If the target is willing, the transformation is automatic and lasts for the duration or until reversed.
- If the target is unwilling, they must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be transformed for the spell’s duration. They may repeat the save at the end of each of their turns.
- If the caster uses a Vitality and a Unique Offering blood pact the transformation becomes permanent unless reversed with Greater Restoration, Remove Curse, or Wish.
- A rooster (or chicken) transformed into a humanoid is always willing, if inexplicably smug about it.

Forms:
- A humanoid becomes a rooster (tiny beast, 1 HP, peck attack, high aggression, prone to crowing loudly).
- A rooster becomes a humanoid of the caster’s choice, with basic clothing and no memory of being a bird (but with lingering sass).

Reversing the Spell:
The caster may end the spell early as an action. Recasting the spell on the same target (while transformed) reverts them.

Rooster Traits:

- Crowing: Emits a deafening *COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO!* once per hour.
- Aggressive: Will charge anything larger than it.
- Peck: Melee Weapon Attack, +3 to hit, 1 tearing damage.

**Blood Pact:** Unique Offering, Vitality Sacrifice

#### Mandatory Compliance Policy
*2nd-level Enchantment*
*Bard, Wizard, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a printed contract, signed in ink)

You invoke a mandatory compliance policy, compelling a creature to act in accordance with an official directive.
 
- The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they must follow a simple command (e.g., "deliver this package," "leave the premises," "cease operations").
- Unlike traditional enchantments, the target rationalizes their compliance within a corporate, legal, or procedural framework.
- If the command violates established company policy (or contradicts the target’s contract obligations), they automatically succeed on the saving throw.
- The spell fails entirely if there is no plausible procedural justification for the action.

**Anomaly Effect:**
- If overused, an invisible compliance officer (an unknown corporate entity) may begin tracking the caster’s "compliance history," leading to unexpected legal ramifications.

---

#### Manifest Anomalous Cataclysm
*9th-level Evocation*
*Wizard, Sorcerer*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 300 feet (1-mile-radius event)
**Duration:** :: 24 hours 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a classified A.S.T.R.A.L. document)

You awaken a dormant anomaly, unleashing an event-scale paranormal disaster.

- Reality in the area distorts, causing gravity fluctuations, spatial rifts, and shifting architecture.
- Anomalous creatures and hazards begin manifesting, acting unpredictably.
- Any spell cast within the zone has a 50% chance of unexpected effects.

- If cast at 10th level, the effect becomes permanent, transforming the area into a quarantined anomaly site.

#### Manifest Arsenal
*2nd-level Conjuration*
*Paladin, Ranger*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 bonus action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

You conjure a floating, spectral weapon that resembles an industrial tool—an arc welder, a hydraulic press, or a razor-edged gear. The weapon hovers in a space you choose and makes melee spell attacks against a creature within 5 feet of it. The weapon deals impact or tearing damage (your choice) equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting modifier.

#### Manifest Workforce
*4th-level Conjuration*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 hour 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a signed corporate requisition form)

You conjure a team of spectral corporate workers who can complete non-combat tasks. They can assemble, repair, organize, or process data at a rate equivalent to ten human workers. If forced into combat, they disperse immediately.

---

#### Mannequin's Lament
*6th-level Enchantment*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 hour 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a doll with sewn-shut eyes)

The target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 18). On a failure, they become paralyzed as their body hardens into wood, glass, or porcelain.
 
- They remain aware but cannot speak or move.
- Any attempt to remove the effect without breaking concentration requires a DC 20 Arcana check.
- If left in this state for the full duration, they remain a mannequin forever unless a wish spell is used.

#### Mass Redaction
*3rd-level Abjuration*
*Cleric, Bard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet (up to 5 creatures)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a stack of classified files)

Up to 5 creatures forget a single traumatic experience, painful memory, or moment of suffering that occurred
 
within the last 24 hours. This does not remove magical charm or domination effects.

---

#### Maw of the Forgotten
*3rd-level Necromancy*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a swallowed tooth, not your own)

A grinning slit opens across your stomach, chest, or throat—an extra mouth that was never meant to be there. The Maw of the Forgotten does not hunger for food, but for concepts, names, and existence itself.
 
- As a bonus action, you may attempt to devour an aspect of reality from a creature you can see within 10 feet. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure:
- They forget their own name for 24 hours.
- Any titles, contracts, or legal records referring to them become unreadable, as though they were never written.
- They suffer disadvantage on all identity-based interactions, including deception and persuasion.
- Each time the Maw feeds, it grows larger, whispering secrets only you can hear.

 Ending the Spell:
- If the caster does not feed it at least once per minute, the Maw becomes hungry, forcing the caster to make an Intelligence saving throw or forget their own past.
- Once the spell ends, the mouth does not fully disappear—it remains as scar tissue, aching whenever something forgotten lingers nearby.

**Anomaly Effect:**
- If cast on the same target twice, they may cease to exist entirely, their body remaining but their presence erased.

#### Mellow Flow
*3rd-level Transmutation*
*Cleric, Sorcerer*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 500 ft.
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

With a confident declaration of “I know a guy,” you tap into the power of connections and influence. For the next few moments, you can easily slip past social barriers, gaining a temporary edge in negotiations, or simply causing others to lower their guard. A subtle aura of calming energy surrounds the caster, creating an almost magical atmosphere of ease.- Effect:- The caster can bypass most social obstacles with ease, whether it’s convincing someone to lend you a hand, smoothing over a tense situation, or gaining access to a restricted area. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target’s defenses are momentarily lowered, leaving them more susceptible to your influence.
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

At Higher Levels:- 5th Level: The duration of the influence extends to 1 minute, allowing for prolonged conversations or more complex social maneuvers.- 11th Level: You can target up to 3 creatures within range, with the same effects applying to all.

#### Midnight Admirer
*1st-level Conjuration*
*Bard, Druid, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal 

You conjure an illusory, impossibly attractive individual tailored to a creature’s preferences—a glowing vision of flirtatious perfection. The phantom makes eye contact, winks, poses, and speaks with a sultry or suave voice. Only the target can hear its words.

When the illusion appears, all creatures within 10 feet of it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, they are flustered until the start of their next turn, suffering disadvantage on Insight and Charisma (Persuasion or Deception) checks.

The phantom lingers for 1 minute, continuing to flirt—but vanishes immediately if the target accepts a date.

If the target refuses, ignores, or reacts negatively to the offer during the spell’s duration, they immediately gain 1 level of exhaustion as their heart and sleep are cursed with regret, longing, and dramatic dream interludes.

Restless Charm:

If the target accepts the date, the illusion disappears with a delighted gasp—but returns during their next long rest, whisking them away on a surreal magical outing.
- The long rest is interrupted.
- The target returns in the morning emotionally drained, gaining a level of exhaustion.
- Additionally, they suffer disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws until their next long rest, as reality feels disappointingly dull compared to their spectral suitor.

If the target refuses the date, the illusion returns every long rest until they accept, interrupting sleep and causing 1 level of exhaustion each time. The illusion is more dramatic every time it returns.

Upon the 6th refusal the illusion will sip the beauty and vitality from the target incuring in the death of the target.

Some scholars argue the phantom is a low-grade romantic fey. Others think it’s just a magical thirst trap with abandonment issues.*

#### Mindspike Detonation
*6th-level Evocation*
*Wizard, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 120 feet 30-foot-radius sphere
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic (A fragment of obsidian implanted in the skin)

You overload the thoughts of all creatures in range. They must make an Intelligence saving throw.
- On a failed save, they take 8d6 cognitive damage and are stunned until the end of their next turn as their thoughts collapse inward, echoing with names they shouldn’t know.  
- On a successful save, they take half damage and resist the mental collapse.

At Higher Levels.  
When cast using an 8th-level spell slot or higher, the radius of the detonation increases to 40 feet.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher:
A chorus of whispered names pulses outward. For 1 minute, your voice overlaps with an unknown one, slightly out of sync.

During the Calamity of Shrouded Stars, Mindspike Detonation was unleashed upon a battlefield, reducing an entire legion to nameless husks. Those who survived swore they heard their own names whispered by the void.
> 
> Spellcasters who use Mindspike Detonation are marked—subtly at first. Their reflections blink at the wrong times, their shadows do not always align with their bodies.*

*3rd-level Enchantment*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Permanent 
**Components:** :: Somatic 

You press your lips against the sleeping target, whispering a glamour that blurs the truth and smooths away inconvenient memories.- The target forgets up to 10 minutes per caster level from the past 24 hours. You choose which moments are erased.- The spell only works on unconscious or willingly sleeping creatures.- If this spell is cast on the same target more than once within a week, their memory begins to unravel:- They suffer disadvantage on Intelligence checks for 24 hours,- And 1 level of exhaustion if they fail a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw.

Those who cross Mirabel rarely remember why they fear her. Only that something precious was stolen while they slept.*

---

#### Mirabel's Final Verse
*9th-level Enchantment*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Permanent until cured 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Material (a vial of black salt, dissolved in a lover’s tear)

You press a lingering, soul-bound kiss onto the target—searing an immortal affliction into their very being. The kiss binds them not to life, but to endless suffering.
- The target contracts a disease or madness of your choice (DM discretion or chosen from existing rules).
- They cannot die by any means—not from wounds, fire, aging, poison, or deprivation.
- When reduced to 0 hit points, the target falls into a state of paralyzed consciousness: aware, feeling pain, but unable to move or speak.
- They do not regenerate, heal, or lose hit points unless healed or damaged magically.
- Only a Greater Restoration or Cure Disease cast by a Cleric of higher level than the caster can remove the affliction.

Creatures cursed in this way have been found years—sometimes centuries—later, whispering forgotten apologies into the void.*

#### Misfiled Presence
*Cantrip Illusion*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

For a brief moment, reality forgets you. You become difficult to track—mundane security cameras blur your image, paperwork listing your location misprints, and witnesses second-guess seeing you. You do not become invisible, but creatures attempting to recall details about you must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

#### Missing Ledger
*Cantrip Divination*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

You cause a single nonmagical item no larger than a book to appear misplaced or absent to those unfamiliar with it. For the duration, creatures other than you must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to notice the object. This effect ends if the item is touched directly.

**Duration:** :: 24 hours 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a glass bead filled with silver ink)

You fortify the mind of a creature against forced memory alterations, cognitive tampering, and external data manipulation.
 
- The target becomes immune to Memory Fragmentation, A.S.T.R.A.L. Redaction, and similar effects.
- Any attempt to modify their memory fails outright, and the caster of the effect must make a Wisdom saving throw or suffer 5d8 cognitive damage.
- The target also remembers everything perfectly for 24 hours, with a near-photographic recall of events.

- At 9th level, this effect becomes permanent unless dispelled.

*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

Target one creature you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw or forget the last 10 minutes of its memory. The effect is permanent unless restored by greater restoration, a cognitive anomaly, or direct exposure to the same event again.

#### Mobster’s Favor
*3rd-level Conjuration*
*Paladin, Ranger*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 120 ft.
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Material (A broken gear)

A tough and grizzled individual materializes before you, dressed in a worn, pinstriped suit and reeking of cigar smoke. He looks around with a mixture of confusion and irritation before fixing his gaze on you.

The tough guy is a capable combatant, able to assist in a fight with decent skill, but he demands upfront payment before lending a hand. He is not one for questions and will accept no explanation or excuses, only calling it “business.”

The tough guy has the following characteristics:- Personality quirks:
	1.	Refers to you as “kid” and insists on using streetwise jargon.
	2.	Lights a cigar during combat and complains about how things used to be better.
	3.	Will break someone’s kneecaps or deliver a threatening glare in exchange for gold.
	4.	Makes vague references to “debts” that the caster “owes” him, but never elaborates.
	5.	Will disappear without a word once the spell ends, often in a puff of smoke, with a brief “yeah, yeah, alright” if given a sandwich.

Combat role: The tough guy is proficient in melee combat, dealing 1d6 + Charisma modifier impact damage per attack. He follows basic combat tactics, focusing on protecting you or the group, but is self-serving and won’t risk his life for anyone’s cause unless it directly benefits him. He will act once in combat, and his loyalty ends as soon as the fight is over.

Additional effects:- He insists on being paid in gold, and if not, he may hold grudges that result in negative consequences for future interactions.- After the fight concludes, the mobster vanishes mysteriously, leaving behind a feeling of “unfinished business.”

#### Momentum Shockwave
*Cantrip Evocation*
*Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self (5ft radius)
**Duration:** :: Instant 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Terrain 
**Terrain:** :: Asphalt

You slam your foot down onto the ground, sending a controlled shockwave rippling through the asphalt, knocking foes back and disrupting their balance.- Saving Throw: Each creature within 5 feet of you must make a Strength saving throw.- On a failed save, the creature is pushed 5 feet away from you.- On a successful save, the creature remains unaffected by the shockwave.- Additionally, any creature that fails the saving throw takes 1d6 sound damage as the shockwave disturbs their equilibrium.

At Higher Levels:- 5th Level: The push distance increases to 10 feet, and the damage increases to 2d6.- 11th Level: The push distance increases to 15 feet, and the damage increases to 3d6. The radius of the shockwave also increases to 10 feet.

You slam your foot onto the solid asphalt beneath you, a tremor spreading out in all directions. The ground rumbles briefly before an invisible wave of force ripples outward, sending those nearby stumbling backward, unbalanced by the shock. The sound of the wave echoes briefly in the air, leaving a brief ringing in the ears of those it affects.*

*Cantrip Illusion*
*Bard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Material (a moth’s wing)

A small, glowing orb resembling a moth flutters within range, pulsing dim light in a 10-foot radius. The orb moves slowly (10 feet per round) in a direction of your choice. If it enters a creature’s space, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw or be briefly mesmerized, reducing its movement speed by half until the start of its next turn.

#### Muttering Solstice of Indignation
*3rd-level Transmutation*
*Wizard, Sorcerer, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 ft Sphere/15 ft (centered on a point you can see)
**Duration:** :: nan 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Material (a piece of a fence post)

You whisper defiant syllables into the Weave, anchoring a sphere of uncooperative momentum into the world. Within the zone, tension hangs in the air—every movement feels optional, replaceable, or rebellious.

While within the sphere, each creature may choose at the start of their turn:- Forego their movement speed for the turn to gain one of the following effects until the start of their next turn:- +1 bonus to AC- One additional weapon attack as part of the Attack action- Advantage on the next saving throw they make

These choices must be made verbally—even whispered—causing faint echoes to ripple in the air.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When you cast this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher, reality trembles slightly:

For the next minute, illusory duplicates of the caster flicker into being around them, mirroring their movements with a one-second delay. They offer no mechanical benefit—but are extremely unsettling.

A beggar in Concord once claimed to be a king undone by this spell. When asked for details, his mouth moved, but no sound emerged.
> Those who cast Muttering Solstice of Indignation say it never feels the same way twice. Each use leaves a trace—on the caster, on the ground, on the timeline.*

#### Mystic Mussel
*Cantrip Conjuration*
*Bard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Material, Somatic, Verbal (A scrap of parchment with gibberish)

You conjure a small, ancient mussel in your hand—enchanted, annoyed, and tightly sealed shut. If anyone tries to pry it open, it vanishes with a faint salty pop, leaving behind only a briny scent.

If spoken to gently and respectfully, the mussel may whisper a cryptic phrase in an ancient tongue or forgotten accent. These utterances are rarely useful and often nonsense, though occasionally they align with bizarre truths.

Once conjured, the mussel lasts for 1 minute or until it disappears. It may be placed on surfaces, used as a very passive familiar, or simply admired.

| d6 | Whispered Phrase                          |

| 4  | Don’t trust the paperclip.                |

*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 1 hour 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a key with no door)

You exist in two places simultaneously, shifting between locations each round. You can take actions from either location, but your form is flickering and unpredictable. Any attempt to track, capture, or observe you results in incomplete or contradictory reports.

#### Obsolescence Protocol
*7th-level Transmutation*
*Wizard, Cleric*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (an outdated ID badge)

You mark a creature as obsolete, and reality enforces the correction. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes 10d10 impact damage and suffers disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks for 1 minute. If the creature has legendary resistances, it must expend one to automatically succeed.

#### Opulent Glare
*Cantrip Illusion*
*Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30ft
**Duration:** :: 1 round 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Terrain 
**Terrain:** :: Marble

You cause a dazzling flash of light to reflect off a nearby surface, like polished marble, momentarily blinding and disorienting any ranged attacker.- Saving Throw: Each creature within a 30-foot radius who makes a ranged attack on their turn must make a Constitution saving throw.- On a failed save, the creature suffers disadvantage on their next ranged attack.- On a successful save, they are unaffected by the dazzling light.

At Higher Levels:- 5th Level: The radius of the effect increases to 40 feet, and the disadvantage lasts for 1 additional round.- 11th Level: The radius of the effect increases to 50 feet, and creatures that fail their saving throw are also blinded until the end of their next turn.

The marble gleams brightly in the light as you invoke the magic, reflecting the sunlight or torchlight in an intense flash. The sudden burst causes ranged attackers to squint, their aim faltering as the brilliance momentarily overwhelms their senses. Those who fail to resist the burst of light find themselves momentarily disoriented, struggling to regain focus before releasing their projectile.*

#### Orb of Let's Not
*1st-level Transmutation*
*Bard, Sorcerer, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 ft.
**Duration:** :: up to 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Material, Somatic (A rusted key)

You conjure a glowing, humming orb of soft pastel light that floats 5 feet off the ground and emits gentle music and phrases like:- “Let’s not do this.”- “Violence is exhausting.”- “Hugs not hits.”- “Come on, talk it out, champ.”

Each creature of your choice within a 10-foot radius of the sphere must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become non-hostile for as long as they remain within the sphere’s area.

They won’t initiate attacks, cast offensive spells, or shout mean things while inside—but they may still pout, sulk, or engage in passive aggression.

The Save DC is equal to: 10 + the creature’s Challenge Rating (rounded down)
This means tougher creatures are less likely to resist the sphere’s charm, because even ancient dragons want to be understood.

While active:- The sphere follows its original position and cannot be moved.- Creatures who exit and re-enter must re-roll their save.- Creatures who are damaged immediately shake off the effect.

| d6 | The Sphere says...                          |
|----|---------------------------------------------|
| 1  | "Let’s take a deep breath."                 |
| 2  | "I’m hearing a lot of anger right now."     |
| 3  | "Let’s find common ground... maybe brunch?" |
| 4  | "It’s not about winning."                   |
| 5  | "I’m on your side. All of your sides."      |
| 6  | *Plays gentle ukulele chords and sighs*     |

**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic

#### Oxidized Strike
*Cantrip Necromancy*
*Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Melee
**Duration:** :: Instant 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Terrain 
**Terrain:** :: Rusted Panel

You channel the corrosive forces of decay into your strike, touching a creature’s armor or weapon with a touch imbued with necrotic energy. The target suffers both chiaric damage and the physical degradation of their gear.- Melee spell attack: Make a melee spell attack against a target. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 chiaric damage.- Armor Degradation: If the target is wearing armor, their AC is reduced by 1 for 1 minute due to rust and corrosion weakening their armor. This reduction stacks with other effects.- Weapon Degradation: If the target is wielding a weapon, it becomes slightly dulled, imposing disadvantage on attack rolls with that weapon until it is repaired or restored.

At Higher Levels:- 5th level: The damage increases to 2d6 necrotic damage, and the AC reduction lasts for 10 minutes.- 11th level: The damage increases to 3d6 necrotic damage, and the AC reduction is applied to all armor worn by the target, including shields.

As you reach out with a swipe or strike, you feel the cold, creeping touch of decay course through your hand, an invisible corrosive aura eating away at the target’s defenses. Where you touch, rust and rot spread in an instant, weakening armor and weapon alike. Your victim recoils as the rust spreads across their equipment, their movements becoming sluggish and uncertain.*

**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 1 hour 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a strand of hair or a fingerprint)

#### Paradox Consecration
*3rd-level Divination*
*Paladin, Cleric*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 ft
**Duration:** :: 5 rounds 
**Components:** :: Material, Somatic, Verbal (a burnt fragment of scripture)

You designate an area as both sanctified and desecrated for 5 rounds. It counts as both types of terrain simultaneously.

While active:- All Sacred Footing and Aura of Sanctity benefits for both Holy and Unholy terrain are active.- Enemies within the area must make a Wisdom saving throw or suffer from Paranoia (disadvantage on Insight, Investigation, and saving throws against fear effects).- You may cast spells that require either Holy or Unholy terrain as though the condition is met.

This creates strange divine interference, and at the start of your turn while concentrating on it, roll a d6:- 1–2: Radiant burst (each creature takes 1d6 radiant)- 3–4: Shadow pulse (each creature heals 1 HP if undead)- 5–6: No extra effect

*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a stamped and signed document)

---

#### Paranormal Trace Obfuscation
*3rd-level Abjuration*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 1 hour 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a broken microchip)

You create an illusory masking layer that scrambles all attempts to detect or track a person or object through digital or magical means.
 
- Spells like Biometric Scan, or Digital Footprint Analysis fail to detect the affected target.
- Any attempt to track the target via facial recognition, digital records, or magical scrying produces false results.
- If someone is already tracking the target when the spell is cast, they must make a Wisdom saving throw or lose the trail entirely.

- At 5th level, the obfuscation lasts 8 hours.
- At 7th level, the effect extends to an entire group (up to 6 creatures).

---

#### Permanent Record
*5th-level Divination*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Permanent 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a government-issued ID)

You extract the complete metaphysical profile of a target creature—its memories, choices, emotional imprints, and karmic residue—manifesting as an encoded construct known as a Permanent Record. The target must be willing, restrained, unconscious, or under a compulsion effect.

Once extracted, the record can be:
- Uploaded to an A.S.T.R.A.L. database, where it becomes permanently trackable across dimensions and planar boundaries.
- Altered with a successful Intelligence (Forgery) check (DC = 10 + target’s level or CR), allowing you to rewrite elements of their identity (alignment, history, public record, or even magical marks).
- Obscured, making the target immune to divination and tracking effects (e.g., Scrying, Zone of Truth, Detect Thoughts) for 7 days. Only Greater Restoration, Wish, or a successful Remove Curse cast at 6th level can reverse the obfuscation.

A creature whose record is altered becomes Altered until restored. Spells that rely on identity or consent may behave unpredictably.

#### Phantasmal Cooler
*2nd-level Conjuration*
*Druid, Ranger*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Material (A plastic bowl)

You conjure an illusory, self-chilling cooler containing up to 3 beverages of your choosing, tailored to the caster’s subconscious preferences. The drinks feel real, taste perfect, and provide subtle magical effects—so long as you don’t try to drink them.

Whenever a creature attempts to drink from the cooler:- The beverage vanishes just before reaching their lips.- The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be momentarily phased out of sync with reality, vanishing into a harmless demi-plane of thirst for 1 minute (as if banished). They reappear in the same spot, mildly irritated.

As long as the cooler remains untouched:- Any creature within 10 feet gains resistance to heat exhaustion and advantage on Constitution checks to resist dehydration or sun exposure.- The area around the cooler remains pleasantly chilled, creating a 20-foot-radius comfort zone in hot climates.

When cast with a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the spell can conjure up to 6 drinks and lasts for 1 hour.

The original blueprint for this spell was recovered from a smudged A.S.T.R.A.L. napkin. Its side effect was unintentional, but field operatives now use it as a passive trap or cooling charm. “Drink if you dare” is often scrawled on the lid.*

#### Phantom Paper Trail
*3rd-level Illusion*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a forged signature)

You do not just alter a document—you bend reality itself to accept the forgery as true for a short period of time.

- When you modify a ledger, contract, employee record, or legal file, the spell imprints its existence into the fabric of the world, making it temporarily irrefutable.
- For the next 10 minutes, any creature reading or interacting with the altered document will believe it is correct, unless they succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check.
- Even memories are briefly affected—a guard whose records have been modified will recall seeing you enter.
- After 10 minutes, the false record vanishes, and reality attempts to correct itself, leaving behind only confusion and a lingering sense that something wasn’t quite right.

**Duration:** :: Up to 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Material, Somatic, Verbal (a broken projector bulb smeared with soot)

You exhale a surging wave of refracted brilliance and bleeding shadow. The chaotic bloom of unnatural light tears across reality, creating a 30-foot cone of pulsing, colorless illumination.

All creatures in the area must make a Constitution saving throw.
- On a failure, a creature takes 7d8 Chiaric damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn.
- On a success, the creature takes half damage and is not blinded.

Surfaces touched by the cascade shimmer faintly with residual interference. The area is considered difficult terrain until the start of your next turn as objects flicker, distort, or bend at strange angles.

- A creature charmed by you automatically fails the saving throw for this spell.

 At higher levels, this spell reveals actual words spoken during the previous encounter (3rd-level slot).

*Cantrip Illusion*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

You gesture subtly, and a phantasmal breeze whispers through an area you can see within range. Curtains billow, candles flicker, papers shift, and cold air brushes the skin. Though entirely illusory, the sensation feels real—enough to distract, unnerve, or suggest a presence unseen.- The wind cannot cause harm or move objects heavier than 5 lbs.- Creatures within the area instinctively glance around. If they are unaware of you or expecting stealth, you may gain advantage on your next Charisma (Deception or Performance) or Dexterity (Stealth) check against them before the end of your next turn.

This cantrip is often used to haunt, mislead, or emphasize one’s words, and is popular among illusionists, tricksters, and dramatists alike.

*Bard, Wizard, Paladin*

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 ft.
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal 

You speak a single, forbidden syllable: A sonic anomaly that cuts beneath thought, identity, and social constraint. The moment it leaves your lips, the word spreads like an invisible shockwave, slipping past armor, modesty, and mental fortitude.

Every creature within 60 feet of you who can hear the word, including yourself, must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to immediately strip all worn items, including clothing, armor, uniforms, accessories, magical attire, and identity-linked gear.

Affected creatures drop whatever they are holding and use their next movement and action (if able) to completely disrobe, regardless of current danger, weather, or social context. The compulsion lasts until the creature has removed all items or is incapacitated.

- The caster is not immune.
- Creatures immune to being charmed are unaffected.
- Deafened creatures or those in soundproof areas are unaffected.
- Constructs or creatures that do not wear gear are unaffected.
- If a creature removes magical protective gear, their AC may drop, and spell effects tied to those items end as usual.

Additional Effects
In addition to its physical effect, the power word unravels falsehoods.
- All illusions, glamers, disguises, and non-permanent magical concealments affecting creatures in range are immediately dispelled, as if targeted by dispel magic.
- Creatures under effects such as disguise self, invisibility, or illusion-based shapeshifting are revealed in their true forms for 1 minute.

In Concord City, this spell is classified as a Class-7 Disruption Event by A.S.T.R.A.L. It was banned after the Incident at the Ivory Banquet, where two boardrooms and an entire opera house experienced simultaneous disrobing. The name of the word remains unrecorded. Those who try to repeat it often bite through their tongues.*

#### Prism Shear

*Wizard, Bard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 hour 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a reprogrammed security badge)

You unleash a pulse of pure polarity—light and shadow intertwined and tearing at each other with violent intensity. This unstable radiance converges on a creature within range, attempting to shear their essence between illumination and oblivion.

The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 12d10 chiaric damage, pulled between the blinding burn of light and the consuming void of shadow. On a success, they take half damage.

If the target is reduced to 0 hit points by this spell, their form is torn into two halves—one vanishing in a beam of searing light, the other collapsing into inky residue.

Some believe Prism Shear is not a spell at all, but a fragment of a failed cosmic division, invoked and weaponized by mortals who never should have touched it.*

With a whispered invocation, you invite the attention of something that drinks the breath between pulses.- The target loses 2 hit points per round for the duration.- The caster gains 1 hit point per round (up to their maximum).- If the target is reduced to 0 hit points this way, they do not fall unconscious immediately.- For 1 round, they remain aware but paralyzed, their vision darkening as they feel a cold, unseen presence leaning in, whispering promises only they can hear.- At the start of their next turn, they fall unconscious unless stabilized by magical means.

At Higher Levels.
When cast using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, increase the damage by 1 HP per round and the healing by 1 HP per round for every level above 3rd.

You call upon divine radiance to flare from the gilded surface of the marble beneath you. The bright light sears those standing within its glow, casting shadows in the wake of its divine fury.- Creatures within 10 feet of the gilded marble or any surface you choose to target must make a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 chiaric damage.- Creatures that fail their saving throw are also blinded until the end of their next turn, as the radiant light temporarily overwhelms their vision.

At Higher Levels:- 5th level: The damage increases to 2d6 radiant, and the radius of the effect expands to 15 feet.- 11th level: The radius increases to 20 feet, and creatures that fail the saving throw are also paralyzed until the end of their next turn.

**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a security clearance chip)

You generate a localized anomaly containment field, shielding the area from external interference.
 
- Prevents forced teleportation, forced mind control, and unauthorized scrying in the area.
- All attempts to manipulate reality inside the zone automatically fail, unless the caster of the effect is higher level than you.

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a shard of broken glass)

You rupture local reality, creating a 20-foot sphere of spatial instability. At the start of each creature’s turn inside the zone, they must make a Constitution saving throw or take 4d10 impact damage as their bodies struggle to remain cohesive. The area is difficult terrain, and teleportation automatically fails within it.

#### Reality Fracture
*8th-level Enchantment*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet (20-foot radius)
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a shard of distorted glass)

You create a glitch in reality, causing multiple overlapping timelines to unfold at once.
 
- Creatures in the area must make an Intelligence saving throw.
- On a failure: They suffer 6d12 cognitive damage, as their mind struggles to process fractured existence.
- On a success: They take half damage and experience sensory distortion, giving them disadvantage on all attacks and saves for 1 round.
 
- Each round, a random anomaly occurs:
- 1-2: The area repeats itself, duplicating any actions that happened in the previous round.
- 3-4: The terrain briefly vanishes, exposing raw void, causing creatures to fall before space reforms.
- 5-6: Time accelerates or slows, making movement speeds randomly double or halve.

#### Reality Integrity Protocol
*5th-level Abjuration*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self (10-foot radius)
**Duration:** :: 1 hour 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a static-charged copper wire)

You project a metaphysical failsafe that prevents involuntary memory alteration and data corruption within a 10-foot radius sphere.

- Any attempt to erase, fragment, or overwrite memories in this area automatically fails.
- Spells like Memory Fragmentation, Compliance Protocol, and A.S.T.R.A.L. Redaction are nullified within the field.
- Digital and paper records within the field are temporarily immune to deletion by magical or technological means.

- At 7th level, the radius extends to 30 feet, covering an entire room.
- At 9th level, the effect becomes permanent in a fixed location, creating an anti-redaction zone.

#### Reality Quarantine
*8th-level Enchantment*
*Cleric, Wizard, Sorcerer*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 120 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 hour per caster level 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a reinforced containment module)

You seal an area within a 60-foot radius in a paranormal quarantine field, cutting it off from reality. While inside, creatures cannot enter or exit via teleportation, portals, or extradimensional travel. The barrier is invisible, but all attempts to perceive or interact with the area from outside automatically fail.
- Extremely powerful creatures (CR 20+) or anomalies may attempt a Charisma saving throw once per hour to destabilize the field.

---

#### Reality Recursion
*6th-level Enchantment*
*Wizard, Cleric*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 minute
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a Möbius strip)

The target is trapped in a self-repeating loop of their last 6 seconds of action, experiencing it over and over until they make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each turn. While trapped, they can take no new actions—only repeat what they did previously.

#### Reality Sidestep
*7th-level Transmutation*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
**Duration:** :: Until dispelled 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (an embossed containment sigil, notarized)
**Acquisition Note:** :: The containment sigil must be notarized at an A.S.T.R.A.L.-approved office, costing 2,500 credits. Unauthorized usage may result in legal fines or containment nullification.

You exist half inside reality, half outside of it. While active:
- You can pass through walls and barriers as long as they are not magical.
- You gain resistance to all physical damage.
- You leave behind a blurred, static afterimage that lingers for 6 seconds before catching up.

**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a shard of uncorrupted reality)

#### Rebuild Reality
*7th-level Enchantment*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a broken clock)

You restore a destroyed or corrupted location (up to 1,000 square feet) to a prior state. This includes buildings, roads, and technological structures—but not living creatures. The restored state must have existed within the last 100 years, and anomalies within the area may resist reconstruction.

---

#### Reconstructive Audit
*7th-level Enchantment*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a medical report detailing the target’s injuries)

The target’s body is reconstructed, restoring all hit points and replacing any lost limbs or organs. If the target was subject to severe mutation or anomalous corruption, the spell attempts to restore their original form.

---

#### Red Tape Barrier
*1st-level Abjuration*
*Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 reaction (when attacked)
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

A shimmering halo of translucent red tape and arcane filing forms around you, swirling with stamps, forms, and glowing sigils marked “PENDING.” The attacker must now navigate a magical bureaucracy in order to strike you effectively.

For the duration, any creature that targets you with an attack must choose one of the following delays:- File a Complaint: The creature takes no action on its next turn, submitting to the magical bureaucracy.- Wait in Line: The creature loses 10 feet of movement for that turn as it’s forced to shuffle through conjured arcane queues.- Ignore Protocol: If the attacker does neither, their attack roll is made at disadvantage.

This effect persists for the spell’s full duration or until you are incapacitated.

The spell was originally created by the Department of Magical Compliance to protect mid-level clerks from workplace aggression. It remains surprisingly effective.*

#### Redacted Identity
*4th-level Enchantment*
*Wizard, Cleric*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 8 hours 
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a bureaucratic form with the target’s name scribbled out, stamped with an identity suppression seal)
**Acquisition Note:** :: *See Blood Seal rules for alternative acquisition methods.*

You strip the target’s presence from legal and magical systems alike, rendering them unrecognizable to contracts, surveillance enchantments, and memory-linked spells. While affected by this spell:

- The target is immune to the Under-Contract condition.  
- Their name cannot be written, spoken, or remembered through magical or technological means.  
- Attempts to bind them through bureaucratic enchantments (such as *Compliance Protocol*, *Digital Summons*, or *Memory Fragmentation*) automatically fail.  
- Any entity trying to recall or reference the target experiences a moment of hesitation, static, or cognitive flicker.  
- Ongoing effects from legal bindings or corporate conditioning are suppressed.  

The spell immediately ends if the target willingly identifies themselves, signs a contract, or submits personal data.

**Arcane Strain:**
Using a Blood Seal instead of the bureaucratic suppression mark inflicts Minor Arcane Strain.

**Blood Pact:** True Name Etching

This spell is illegal in all A.S.T.R.A.L.-regulated zones and may trigger automated containment review if detected.*

#### Redacted Statement
*Cantrip Enchantment*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 reaction, when a creature attempts to speak within 30 feet of you
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal 

You distort a single spoken word, causing it to be completely omitted from a sentence. This does not change meaning but leaves an obvious gap, as if the speaker momentarily forgot the word or it was intentionally censored. If used against a spellcaster, their spell is unaffected, but they experience a brief moment of dissonance.

---

#### Redacted Trauma
*3rd-level Enchantment*
*Cleric, Bard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a sealed envelope containing classified information)

You remove one Cognitive condition from a willing creature, allowing them to forget the most painful elements tied to their trauma. This could include the following conditions:
Paranoid, Aroused, Frightened, Stunned, Compelled, Charmed

The creature retains functional memories but is relieved of the emotional and psychological burden associated with the specific condition. For example, if a creature is Frightened by an event, they may feel no further fear from that specific trauma, but their memory of the event will remain intact.

This spell is effective at alleviating the mental burden caused by Cognitive conditions and allows the creature to act without the weight of the affliction temporarily affecting their behavior or mental clarity.

Note: This spell does not remove conditions related to physical afflictions, nor does it erase conditions like Blinded, Poisoned, or other non-Cognitive states.

#### Redlight in a Pocket
*4th-level Conjuration*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: 3 actions
**Range:**        :: 0
**Duration:** :: 5 hours + 1 hour/level 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a satin ribbon, bound with a secret never spoken aloud)

You conjure a sealed, unearthly chamber, where indulgence flows like silk and no outside force may intrude.

- The 15-foot-diameter space is soundproof, protected from weather, and forbiddingly private.
- The caster can shape the interior at will, conjuring cushions, incense, and music that hums from the walls themselves.
- Those who rest inside awaken feeling like time itself curled around them, leaving them untouched.

#### Refraction of Self
*4th-level Conjuration*
*Sorcerer, Wizard, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Bonus Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic (A shard of a broken mirror)

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
Your form fractures slightly from this world, your outline flickering and bending at unnatural angles. When injured, reality itself offers you an escape—but not always a reliable one.

While this spell is active, each time you take damage, you may immediately teleport up to 20 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. This reaction does not cost an action or reaction.

You must have line of sight to teleport intentionally. If no valid space exists, the teleportation fails.

While this spell is active, you cast no reflection on reflective surfaces

At Higher Levels.
When cast using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, your controlled teleportation range increases to 30 feet.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher:
Reality trembles slightly, and for the next minute, shadows of your previous movements flicker half a second behind you. Enemies have disadvantage on opportunity attacks against you.

In the city of Concord, Unstable Reality Surge is outlawed, for it was once used by the cult of the Silent Maw to unmake a senator in broad daylight. Witnesses swore they saw his shadow scream before vanishing entirely.
> 
> Those who cast Unstable Reality Surge often find that they dream differently afterward. They dream of corridors that stretch into infinity, doors that lead to places older than time.*

#### Regulated Fertility Control
*2nd-level Enchantment*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: 10 minutes
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Permanent (until revoked) 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a biometric ID chip)

A state-issued biological override ensures total reproductive regulation, granting or preventing fertility based on anomalous genetic programming or corporate mandates.
 
- You must register the procedure within a recognized biological oversight agency or an equivalent A.S.T.R.A.L. fertility governance database.
- The recipient’s reproductive ability is altered per official documentation—either activated, suspended, or set on a predetermined cycle.
- A recipient may petition for reversal, requiring an administrative appeal and 48-hour processing delay.

- Attempts to circumvent the procedure (via dispel magic or natural means) trigger an automatic health verification scan, possibly flagging the recipient for investigation.

**Anomaly Effect:**
In rare cases, biological data corruption results in spontaneous genetic mutations—some with unpredictable side effects.

#### Remote Office
*3rd-level Enchantment*
*Wizard, Cleric*

**Casting Time:** :: 10 minutes
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 8 hours 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a stack of paperwork)

You conjure a fully furnished mobile workspace, complete with a desk, terminals, filing cabinets, and an encrypted connection to an external network. The office is soundproof and can be dismissed instantly as an action.

---

#### Remove Aromate
*2nd-level Transmutation*
*Druid, Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Reaction (when an enemy attacks)
**Range:**        :: 500 ft. Radius/50 ft
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

You temporarily erase all aromatic substances within a 50-foot radius centered on yourself. Foods instantly become tasteless, perfumes and deodorants lose their fragrance, and creatures develop noticeably unpleasant body odors or breath as natural smells dominate.

Creatures within the affected area become distracted by the sudden lack or distortion of familiar aromas. Any creature attempting Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Insight) checks relying on smell within the spell’s radius does so at disadvantage.

When the spell ends, aromas slowly return to normal over the next minute.

Roleplay Suggestions:- This spell could disrupt diplomatic meetings or social gatherings.- Restaurants or perfumers may ban this spell outright, viewing it as destructive or offensive.

At Higher Levels (Scaling):- When cast using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the radius increases by 20 feet per spell level above 2nd.- At 5th level or higher, the spell can selectively erase stronger or more specific aromatics (such as poisons, toxins, or pheromones), possibly neutralizing their effects temporarily.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
A distorted A.S.T.R.A.L. directive warns about “the catastrophic consequences of categorical aromatic erasure.” The document abruptly glitches at the mention of “mint,” leaving you uncertain about the full implications of aroma removal.*

#### Residual Anomaly Energy
*2nd-level Enchantment*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

Your form becomes unstable, shifting between dimensions. Until the spell ends, you gain advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and attacks against you have disadvantage unless they rely on True Sight or A.S.T.R.A.L. surveillance.

---

#### Residual Imprint
*2nd-level Enchantment*
*Bard, Wizard, Cleric*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a glass shard from a broken window)

You touch a surface and pull residual emotions, whispered words, and sensory echoes from its past. These are not spirits, but impressions left by heightened emotions—love, fear, guilt, rage.
 
- As long as you concentrate, you experience faded flashes of what transpired in the location over the last 24 hours (or up to 10 years for a higher-level cast).
- You may see blurred faces, hear indistinct voices, or feel the emotions of the past occupants.
- If a violent crime was committed here, the spell may temporarily create an echo, repeating the event as a flickering hallucination that others can witness.

**Anomaly Effect:**
If overused in one place, the imprints might notice you back, becoming aware that they are being observed.

---

#### Residual Presence
*4th-level Divination*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 hour 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a business card left behind by the deceased)

You conjure a faint imprint of a recently deceased individual. This imprint is a vague, shadowy projection capable of answering up to three questions before it fades. It cannot be compelled to lie, but its responses may be fragmented or incomplete.

---

#### Resonant Clang
*Cantrip Evocation*
*Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 15ft
**Duration:** :: Instant 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Terrain 
**Terrain:** :: Metal Grating

You focus the sound of your steps and amplify the resonant clatter of metal beneath you, creating a sharp, ringing clang that reverberates through the environment. The disruptive noise causes nearby creatures to lose focus and become disoriented.- Creatures within a 15-foot radius of the source must make a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 sound damage and have disadvantage on Perception checks for the next minute as they struggle to recover from the ringing.- The sound effects can be heard clearly through solid objects, and creatures within range must make a second saving throw if they are engaged in any concentration spells or abilities. On a failure, their concentration is broken.

At Higher Levels:- 5th level: The radius increases to 30 feet, and the creatures now also suffer disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of their next turn, as their hearing and focus are affected by the noise.- 11th level: Creatures that fail their saving throw are also stunned for 1 round, as the sonic shockwave disorients them even further.

You slam your feet against the metal grating, and the amplified clang reverberates across the battlefield. The sound is so intense it rattles the bones of your enemies, disorienting their senses and clouding their judgment. The metallic hum lingers in the air as they struggle to regain their composure.*

#### Revelation of the Flesh
*1st-level Divination*
*Cleric, Paladin, Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Material (a sliver of clear quartz)

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
You place your hand on a willing creature and channel a diagnostic pulse of divinatory energy. For a brief moment, their body becomes transparent to your senses, revealing hidden disruptions or irregularities within.

You detect the presence of any internal affliction, including:
- Natural or magical diseases
- Poisons or chemical imbalances
- Curses with a biological or physiological component
- Arcane mutations or lingering experimental side effects

You immediately learn the type of affliction present (e.g., “necrotic infection,” “alchemical toxin,” or “soul-linked corruption”). You do not learn the exact name or nature of the condition unless you succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence (Medicine or Arcana) check.

Creatures without any detectable affliction feel nothing. Afflicted creatures may feel a brief sting, or other harmless somatic response depending on the nature of their condition.

---

#### Reverb Cloak
*Cantrip Illusion*
*Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Terrain 
**Terrain:** :: Concrete Tunnels

You attune your presence to the resonating echoes of the surrounding environment, causing your form to distort and flicker like a ripple in sound. In places with reflective or hollow surfaces, such as concrete tunnels or other echoing terrains, your form becomes harder to focus on, creating confusion and uncertainty.- The first attack against you each round has disadvantage, as your form fluctuates within the echoes, making it difficult for enemies to track your exact location.- While the spell lasts, you gain advantage on Stealth checks to hide in areas with echoing acoustics, such as tunnels, caves, or large, noisy chambers.

At Higher Levels:- 5th level: The spell now grants advantage on saving throws against any abilities that would reveal your position or detect your presence, such as Divination or perception-based effects.- 11th level: Creatures within 10 feet of you that make an attack roll against you also take 1d4 sonic damage as they are disoriented by the reverberations.

The sound around you warps, bending and distorting with each subtle movement. The rhythmic pulse of your steps creates ripples in the air, making it difficult for enemies to pinpoint you amidst the shifting echoes of the walls. In the oppressive silence of the concrete tunnels, your presence is felt, but never fully seen, and your enemies are left chasing after fleeting sounds, unaware of your true location.*

#### Reversed Gravity Bubble
*5th-level Transmutation*
*Sorcerer, Wizard, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet 10-foot-radius sphere
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (A drop of mercury)

You create a shimmering sphere of warped gravitational pull, 10 feet in radius, centered on a point within range. Within this bubble, gravity reverses erratically, pulling objects and creatures toward the ceiling, sideways, or suspending them in a nauseating spin.

Effects on Casting:- All creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw.- On a failure, a creature is flung 20 feet straight upward, taking fall damage (2d6) upon descent unless they can catch themselves or land safely.- On a success, the creature manages to stabilize but still floats awkwardly, suffering disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks until they exit the area.

Ongoing Effects (Each Round):

At the start of each of your turns while concentration is maintained:- Roll a d4 to determine the gravitational direction.

Creatures that remain in the area suffer mild disorientation and have disadvantage on ranged attacks and Dexterity saving throws while inside the sphere.

If cast using a 7th-level spell slot or higher, the gravitational direction changes at the start of every creature’s turn instead of only the caster’s.

| d4 Roll | Gravity Surge Effect                                                                 |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | Upward – Creatures must make a Dexterity save or be lifted again.               |
| 2       | Sideways (caster’s left) – Creatures are thrown 10 feet to the side, potentially colliding with surfaces. |
| 3       | Downward Surge – Gravity doubles briefly; all movement is halved and unsecured objects slam to the ground (1d6 damage). |
| 4       | Zero-G Lull – Creatures float freely, unable to take reactions until the start of their next turn. |

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a result of 15 or higher, reality ripples strangely. Loose objects in a 60-foot radius briefly levitate an inch off the ground, then drop.

Deep within the catacombs of Old Concord, the walls bear carvings of Reversed Gravity Bubble. The inscriptions shift when unobserved, as if the stone itself is trying to remember something it once forgot.

#### Revulsion
*3rd-level Enchantment*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 1 turn + 1 round/level 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a neural disruptor patch)

A sensory overload in the target’s pleasure-response cortex creates an overwhelming repulsion toward all forms of intimacy.
 
- The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become physically nauseated at the thought of intimacy.
- Disadvantage on Charisma-based rolls involving seduction, persuasion, or charm effects.
 
 The reverse of this spell, "Pleasure Numbness," removes all sexual or emotional distress responses for 24 hours, making the target indifferent to physical stimuli.

---

#### Rhythmic Movement
*Cantrip Conjuration*
*Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 1 round 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Terrain 
**Terrain:** :: Parquet Wood

The natural flow of the parquet wood beneath you guides your movements as you flicker momentarily between positions, destabilizing your form and reappearing in a more advantageous stance.- You gain advantage on your next Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or melee attack roll made before the end of your next turn.- If you are within 5 feet of a surface or object (like a wall or ledge), you can use your bonus action to teleport up to 10 feet in any direction within range. This teleportation does not provoke opportunity attacks.

At Higher Levels:- At 5th level: The range of your teleportation increases to 15 feet.- At 11th level: You can also gain advantage on the first saving throw made against being restrained, paralyzed, or stunned during the turn the spell is cast.

As you channel the natural flow of the parquet wood underfoot, you feel your body sync with the rhythm of the world around you. With a sudden flicker, your position changes, leaving only a brief blur behind before you land in a new, more favorable spot. The pulse of the earth beneath you supports your every movement, creating a seamless blend of natural agility and supernatural grace.*

#### Ricochet Shot
*3rd-level Evocation*
*Ranger*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Weapon's Range
**Duration:** :: Until start of next turn 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

You fire a bullet that ricochets between multiple targets. Make a ranged weapon attack against a creature within range. On a hit, the bullet then leaps to up to two additional creatures, each within 15 feet of the previous target. Each additional target requires a separate attack roll and takes half damage on a hit.

1 target per level above 3rd

#### Rodent of Frost
*1st-level Conjuration*
*Bard, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal 

You summon a single, spectral rat formed of condensed frost and arcane chill. It scurries off immediately, following an inexplicable instinct.- The rat automatically seeks the coldest location within a 200-foot radius, regardless of visibility or accessibility.- It can sense cold through barriers, insulation, or seals—even within a hermetically sealed container like a locked freezer.- As it moves, it leaves behind a trail of tiny frost-lined footprints, which last for 1 minute before sublimating.

The rat is entirely uninterested in combat and disappears instantly if initiative is rolled or hostilities begin nearby.

It does not squeak. It does not stop. It does not care. It simply… finds the cold.*

#### Rotating Opus of Indignation
*4th-level Evocation*
*Cleric, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Reaction- After you fail a saving throw
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
**Range:**        :: 30 ft Sphere/20 ft
**Duration:** :: nan 
**Components:** :: Somatic 

As your mind cracks under pressure, you unleash an anomalous pulse of rhythm and defiance—a stuttering cosmic melody that replays itself, over and over, across the battlefield. The air pulses in time with an unseen waltz. Reality blinks.

When you fail a saving throw, you may cast this spell to release a psychic backlash in a 20-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range.

Each creature in the area must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they take 4d8 chiaric damage, and are staggered, unable to take reactions until the start of their next turn. On a success, they take half damage and suffer no additional effect.

Once per round for the duration (1 round), the melody echoes faintly again at initiative count 0. Creatures that failed their original save feel a tremor of déjà vu and take 1 psychic damage as the rhythm loops.

At Higher Levels:

When you cast this spell using a 5th-level spell slot or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher:
“You hear a musical note that doesn’t exist in this octave. The ground pulses beneath your feet. One random creature (including possibly yourself) must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be forced to dance uncontrollably for 1 round, unable to take actions.”

Something unknown has touched this magic, leaving behind traces of those who have cast it before.
> 
> The phantom ship *Elder’s Lament* was last seen adrift in the Void Sea, its captain having invoked Rotating Opus of Indignation in a desperate bid to escape the Hunt. The ship is still seen, sometimes, but never in the same place twice.
> 
> The very air around Rotating Opus of Indignation seems to recoil, as if reality itself wishes to avoid acknowledging its existence. It is a spell that should not be, yet is.*

#### Runes of Inconsequence
*Cantrip Illusion*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

You inscribe a rune onto a piece of paper, document, or surface. The rune hums with unstable magical nonsense, waiting for the next creature to read or open the marked object. When triggered, the rune unleashes a harmless but dramatic effect that startles, annoys, or mildly entertains.

The effect is randomly determined by rolling a d6:

The rune fades after being triggered. A creature that succeeds a DC 13 Arcana check while inspecting the document can spot the rune before triggering it.

At Higher Levels:
You can place one additional rune per spellcasting modifier (minimum of 1), but only one rune may be triggered at a time, and all runes share the same effect for the day.

d6 | Harmless Effect
---|----------------
1  | A burst of confetti and a trumpet fanfare plays.
2  | The reader hears a magical raspberry blown directly into their ear.
3  | A tiny banner pops out: “Gotcha!”
4  | The paper insults the reader in a refined accent.
5  | Glitter explodes everywhere. It sticks.
6  | A small illusory bird flaps out and poops ghost ink on them.

**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal, Material (A pinch of salt)

You channel a fleeting pulse of arcane code into a digital system, spoofing credentials and bypassing access protocols. When you touch an electronic device—such as a keypad, terminal, biometric scanner, or smart lock—you override its access layer and temporarily gain full control.

- Simple security (home locks, office terminals, consumer-grade encryption) is bypassed automatically.
- High-security systems (e.g., bank vaults, government archives, corporate mainframes) require a successful Intelligence (Arcana) check against the system’s encryption level (see table).
- This spell does not affect physical locks without a digital component.
- If used on a connected network, the intrusion is notified to its host system within 1 minute, unless the caster succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Stealth Tools) check (if applicable).

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you gain advantage on the Arcana check for each slot level above 2nd.

- It emits a subtle warmth or chill to those who touch it.  
- It causes a sense of unease or dread when handled.  
- It makes the marked object feel subtly *wrong* to the attuned.

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet

*Cantrip Evocation*
*Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 5ft
**Duration:** :: Instant 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Terrain 
**Terrain:** :: Glass Floor

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
You focus a controlled vibration into the glass floor beneath you, causing a sudden concussive burst that shatters the surface. The shockwave ripples outward, damaging those within range.- Adjacent creatures (within 5 feet) must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take 1d6 sonic damage and are deafened until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, they take half damage and are not deafened.- You suffer no ill effects from the glass beneath you, and you remain unharmed.

At Higher Levels:- At 5th level: The radius of the blast increases to 10 feet.- At 11th level: The damage increases to 2d6.- At 17th level: The deafening effect lasts for 1 minute and can be dispelled by a creature using a Heal or Lesser Restoration spell.

The druid channels the earth’s natural vibrations through the glass floor, using it as a conduit for explosive energy. The floor shatters like glass under the force of a wave, sending concussive shockwaves into any creature unlucky enough to be nearby. The spell’s precise vibration control makes it an effective tool for both damaging enemies and disrupting their balance, while the unique use of sound as a weapon provides an eerie, almost supernatural quality to the druid’s powers.*

#### Skin Unwoven
*7th-level Necromancy*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a thread soaked in human blood)

You weave an invisible suture in the air, connecting it to the target’s flesh and nerves. The thread does not cut, it unravels, pulling the skin away in delicate layers.

- The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, their flesh begins to separate from their body, piece by piece.
- Round 1: Their fingertips and lips begin to curl and peel, exposing raw flesh.
- Round 2: The skin along their arms and jaw pulls loose, hanging like discarded parchment.
- Round 3: Their entire face and chest are stripped, leaving only muscle and exposed nerves.

- The target takes 4d10 chiaric damage per round and suffers disadvantage on all Dexterity-based actions due to agony.
- If the spell lasts the full minute, the target is left entirely skinless, a raw, quivering thing, forced to exist in constant, unbearable sensation.

Skinless Condition:  
- The creature has disadvantage on all saving throws against pain, stun, or fear effects.  
- They are vulnerable to pyric and radiation damage.  
- They cannot benefit from healing spells other than *Reconstructive Audit* or *First Responder Algorithm* until ritually treated.  
- They are permanently disfigured, unless magically or surgically restored.  

End of the Spell:  
- The target may repeat the Constitution save at the end of each of their turns. On a success, the unweaving halts but does not reverse—what has been lost remains lost.  
- If the spell is cast multiple times on the same target, their skin may begin to regrow incorrectly, forming anomalous grafts that twitch and whisper in forgotten tongues.

**Anomaly Effect:**
- If cast repeatedly, the peeled skin may attempt to reform itself into something separate, crawling and watching from the corners of the room.

*Bard*

**Casting Time:** :: Special
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Special

- The caster awakens fully refreshed, as if they had slept those stolen hours.
- If the spell is cast repeatedly on the same victim, their dreams begin to fray, unraveling into visions of things best left unseen.

Your body adapts to the environment, allowing you to glide over the floor, avoiding interference from foes.- You can take the Disengage action as a bonus action on this turn.- You cannot provoke opportunity attacks from creatures during this round.

A druid whose connection to nature extends even to the man-made, finds that smooth, slippery surfaces enhance their innate agility. They become one with the fluidity of their environment, gracefully dodging and flowing with the world around them. The smoothness of linoleum beneath their feet, while mundane to others, is an avenue for their effortless escape from danger, as they shift with the ease of water slipping through their fingers.*

**Duration:** :: 1 round 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

You speak with a voice that does not belong to you—layered, shifting, and wrong.
 
One creature of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save:
- The creature flinches involuntarily, disrupting its focus.
- If it takes an action on its next turn, it must spend its bonus action first, if available.
- If it has no bonus action to use, its speed is reduced by 10 feet instead.

 A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

A veil of otherworldly clarity shrouds the target, severing their mind from chemical, magical, or emotional distortion.- The target becomes immune to alcohol, narcotics, pleasure-enhancing magic, and any enchantments that manipulate perception or judgment.- They remain unnaturally composed, able to see through illusions, resist temptation, and stay grounded even in the grip of hallucination or desire.- The target cannot be charmed, intoxicated, or seduced for the duration.

A priest of A.S.T.R.A.L. once described the sensation as “staring into the abyss while the abyss begs you to blink.”*

*Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 ft.
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

You unleash a burst of targeted emotional disruption based on the black site experiment RAGE-031. One creature of your choice within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or succumb to uncontrollable fury.

While affected, the target is enraged, experiencing an irrational compulsion to lash out. At the start of each of its turns, roll a d6 to determine the target’s behavior:

The rage lasts for 1 minute or until the target takes damage. A creature under this effect is considered charmed by the rage itself and cannot willingly end it early.

At Higher Levels:
When cast with a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you may target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Solid Footing
*Cantrip Abjuration*
*Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 1 round 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Terrain 
**Terrain:** :: Concrete

You draw strength from the stability of concrete beneath your feet, solidifying your posture and ensuring that you cannot be easily moved. Your connection to the earth gives you exceptional resistance to being pushed or knocked down.

You gain advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made to resist knockback or any effects that would push, pull, or topple you. This effect lasts until the start of your next turn.

At Higher Levels:
When you reach higher levels, the ability strengthens:- 5th level: You can now resist grapples and restraining effects with advantage as well.- 11th level: You also gain resistance to forced movement, such as telekinetic pushes or teleportation effects that seek to reposition you.

A druid attuned to the urban landscape or the resilience of built environments uses concrete’s unyielding nature to channel an innate stability. They sense the deep foundation of the ground beneath them, drawing on its permanence to stand firm against any attempt to disrupt their position. The caster’s posture straightens as if they themselves have become part of the unmovable structure around them, ready to resist whatever forces attempt to unseat them.*

At Higher Levels:- At 5th level: The temporary hit points increase to 2d4.- At 11th level: The effect of the spell extends to allies within 10 feet of you, granting them 1d4 temporary hit points as well.- At 17th level: The temporary hit points increase to 3d4, and the duration is extended to 1 hour instead of just being until your next rest.

A druid who has learned to embrace the comfort of natural softness manifests a calming aura as they attune to the environment around them. The soothing nature of soft, plush materials like velvet becomes a channel for their connection to comfort, warmth, and rejuvenation. As they breathe in deeply, the tension in their body releases, replaced by a quiet, resilient strength, echoing the peaceful tranquility of the soft carpet beneath their feet.*

Choose one creature within range. That target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be dragged up to 30 feet in a straight line toward the space it occupied at the start of its previous turn.

- If the target collides with a solid object or creature during this forced movement, it takes 6d12 void damage, and the object or creature it struck takes half as much.
- On a successful save, the target is not moved, but still takes half damage from the forceful retraction.

- 5th level: 2d6
- 11th level: 3d6
- 17th level: 4d6

Urban druids who specialize in interior architecture and sustainable urban environments often rely on wooden elements to channel their magic.

**Range:**        :: 30ft
**Duration:** :: Instant 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Terrain 
**Terrain:** :: Office Carpet

Harnessing the ambient static energy in the surroundings, you gather a charge from the office carpet, the fibers crackling with electric potential. With a sudden release, you unleash a crackling arc of lightning toward a target.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
Make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 electric damage. If the target is wearing metal armor or has metal equipment, the damage increases by 1, making the strike particularly painful.

At Higher Levels:
The damage increases when you reach higher levels:- 5th level: 2d6- 11th level: 3d6- 17th level: 4d6

In modern environments, especially in offices or warehouses, druids attuned to urban ecosystems often make use of mundane, overlooked energy sources like the static charge from carpets, furniture, and other everyday objects. The caster feels the tiny crackles of static energy building around them, their hand briefly glowing with arcane power before they release the lightning-like spark at their target, often surprising the unprepared.*

#### Static Field
*Cantrip Evocation*
*Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10ft
**Duration:** :: Instant 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Terrain 
**Terrain:** :: Maintenance Grating

By reaching toward an exposed maintenance grate or metallic conduit, you unleash a sharp surge of static electricity, discharging the built-up current into nearby enemies.

Choose one creature within 10 feet of you that is standing on or adjacent to metal flooring, a grate, conduit, or similar surface. That creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 electric damage and lose its reaction until the start of its next turn.

At Higher Levels:
The spell’s damage increases when you reach higher levels:- 5th level: 2d4- 11th level: 3d4- 17th level: 4d4

Urban druids and infrastructure witches have long known how to manipulate the invisible flows of static that build beneath cities. A quick gesture, a whispered word, and the ambient hum becomes a stinging pulse. It doesn’t stop hearts—but it might stop someone from drawing steel.
> 
> The faint smell of ozone and dust lingers in the air after the spell discharges.*

#### Static Veil
*Cantrip Enchantment*
*Wizard, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 1 round 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

A faint hum distorts reality around you. Until the start of your next turn, any attempt to record or broadcast your presence via analog or digital devices produces static, blurred imagery, or flickering distortions. This does not prevent direct observation, but any recorded footage will appear corrupted or unusable.

---

#### Step Between Forms
*4th-level Illusion*
*Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic (A shred of black silk)

You blur at the edges, your body slipping into the seams of unreality. Shadows cling to you unnaturally, muting your presence, your weight, your warmth. You become a half-whisper in the world of form.

While the spell is active:- You gain resistance to all damage except radiant and cognitive.- You cannot physically interact with creatures or objects (you pass through doors but cannot open them; you cannot attack or cast spells requiring material components).- You are considered heavily obscured to creatures relying on normal sight and invisible in dim light or darkness.- You can move through non-magical objects and walls as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 void damage if you end your turn inside a solid object.

At Higher Levels:

If you cast this spell using a 6th-level slot or higher, you may choose to phase through magical barriers (like Wall of Force) as long as you are not being directly observed.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher: Reality trembles slightly, causing a ripple that lingers unseen.

Something unknown has touched this magic, leaving behind traces of those who have cast it before.
> 
> The phantom ship *Elder’s Lament* was last seen adrift in the Void Sea, its captain having invoked Shadow's Embrace in a desperate bid to escape the Hunt. The ship is still seen, sometimes, but never in the same place twice.
> 
> The very air around Shadow's Embrace seems to recoil, as if reality itself wishes to avoid acknowledging its existence. It is a spell that should not be, yet is.*

#### Sterile Veil
*2nd-level Enchantment*
*Cleric, Druid, Wizard, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 1 turn/level 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a mold-covered silver coin)

You conjure a shimmering veil of pale green energy across the target’s skin, filtering their body from infection both mundane and magical.- The target becomes immune to contracting, carrying, or transmitting any disease for the duration.- Any disease currently affecting them is rendered dormant—its symptoms subside and it cannot worsen, but it is not cured.- While affected, the target emits a subtle aroma of antiseptic and burnt sugar. Creatures with keen smell may sense this aura.

If this spell is cast repeatedly on the same creature without curing the underlying disease, roll a DC 12 Constitution saving throw for the target after the third use in a day. On a failure, they gain one level of exhaustion as their immune system becomes paradoxically hypersensitive and destabilized.

Healers who overuse this veil often report phantom fevers or hallucinated symptoms, as if their bodies are grieving the absence of illness.*

#### Stillness of the Grave
*Cantrip Abjuration*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal 

You slow your breathing and still your pulse, imitating the lifeless calm of a corpse. Until the spell ends, you appear dead to mundane inspection, such as touch or sight. A creature that physically examines you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check to determine that you are still alive. This effect does not suppress your ability to move or speak, but any voluntary action ends the spell immediately.

---

#### Stone Ship
*6th-level Conjuration*
*Wizard, Druid, Sorcerer*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 120 ft.
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Material, Somatic, Verbal (A plastic bowl)

You conjure a magically reinforced stone ship at a point you can see within range. The ship appears instantly and gently settles without causing damage, regardless of its immense weight.- If summoned onto water:
The ship immediately sinks to the bottom without damage and remains indefinitely as a stable underwater structure.- If summoned onto land or any solid surface:
The ship appears safely resting on the ground, remaining for 1 minute before vanishing harmlessly. It can serve as temporary cover, shelter, or a temporary barricade during this time.

Creatures or objects caught underneath when the ship is conjured are gently pushed aside and take no damage.

- The ship cannot cause physical harm due to its magical weightlessness when conjured.
- Provides half-cover (+2 AC) to creatures aboard or behind it.
- Once summoned, the ship cannot be moved or manipulated by normal physical means due to its immense (though magically nullified) weight.

| Spell Slot Level | Ship Size       | Capacity                          |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1st              | Tiny (5 ft.)    | Fits 1 Small creature comfortably |
| 2nd              | Small (10 ft.)  | Fits up to 2 Medium creatures     |
| 3rd              | Medium (20 ft.) | Fits up to 6 Medium creatures     |
| 4th              | Large (40 ft.)  | Fits up to 12 Medium creatures    |
| 5th              | Huge (60 ft.)   | Fits up to 30 Medium creatures    |

#### Summon Pest
*2nd-level Conjuration*
*Paladin, Ranger*

**Casting Time:** :: Reaction (when someone draws a weapon)
**Range:**        :: 60 ft.
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Material, Verbal (A feather from a random bird)

You summon the pest—an immortal, mildly sentient mosquito designated Pest-1 in A.S.T.R.A.L. records. There is only one such mosquito in existence, and this spell temporarily returns it from its dormant state. The mosquito appears within 5 feet of the most important person in the area (DM’s discretion) and begins an aggressive buzzing and biting campaign.
- If Summon Pest is cast again: Pest-1 is not duplicated. It simply relocates to the new target, abandoning the old one unless they are still within 30 feet of the new caster, in which case it harasses both.
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
- If no suitable target exists: Pest-1 vanishes into non-space until summoned again.
- If the target becomes untargetable (e.g., invisible, banished): Pest-1 immediately shifts to the next most “important” person in the room.
- If someone other than the original caster uses the spell: Pest-1 recognizes this and updates its priorities accordingly, often begrudgingly.

Mechanical Effect:
The affected creature is considered distracted for 1 minute:
- Disadvantage on concentration checks.
- Cannot benefit from the Invisible condition.
- Any attack rolls made against the creature have advantage if they rely on sound or movement (e.g., tremorsense or blindsight).

At Higher Levels:
Casting this spell using a slot of 3rd level or higher causes Pest-1 to gain memory of the target. The next time it’s summoned, it will return to the previous target unless they are farther than 1 mile from the caster.

Pest-1 is believed to predate Concord City. It has no known predator, no known prey, and no biological need to feed—yet it does. Repeated exposure to Pest-1 has caused breakdowns in test subject behavior, often leading to social ruin, combat mistakes, or existential despair.*

#### Summon the Saint
*6th-level Necromancy*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 hour
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Permanent until fulfilled 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a black candle, a silver coin, and the target’s written name on parchment)

You invoke the Assassins of the Saint, a hidden order of executioners bound by ancient contracts. This spell marks a target for death, ensuring that they will never know peace again.

- At dawn the next day, the target awakens with a blood-red rose placed on their chest.
- From this moment, Assassins of the Saint will begin hunting them.
- The first assassin arrives within 1d6 days, with each subsequent hunter increasing in lethality.

 Counterplay & Removal:
- The mark cannot be dispelled through normal means.
- Only by making an offering of equal or greater worth (to the Saint’s order) can the mark be transferred to another soul.

The Saint’s Will is Absolute:
> If the caster attempts to interfere, they too receive the mark of the blood rose.*

#### Sunder the Mind
*4th-level Evocation*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a cassette tape)

You summon a storm of distorted analog signals, corrupted waveforms, and audio screeches that flood the minds of all creatures in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 5d8 sound damage and is stunned until the start of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half damage and is not stunned.

**Blood Pact:** Offering of Self

---

#### Sure Disease
*1st-level Necromancy*
*Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 20ft
**Duration:** :: 3 Days 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

You guarantee that your target contracts a non-lethal but incredibly annoying illness. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become afflicted for the duration. While afflicted, the target suffers one randomly determined symptom.

Roll a d10 on the Inconvenient Affliction Table to determine the effect:

At Higher Levels:
When cast using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you may roll twice and apply both afflictions (reroll duplicates).

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
| d10 | Inconvenient Affliction                              |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Uncontrollable sneezing. Disadvantage on Stealth checks. |
| 2   | Randomly itchy elbows. Disadvantage on ranged attacks.   |
| 3   | Cannot pronounce the letter "R." Verbal components sound ridiculous. |
| 4   | Burps loudly every time they speak. Disadvantage on Persuasion checks. |
| 5   | Excessive sweating. Must make a DC 10 Dex save to avoid dropping items. |
| 6   | One leg falls asleep. Movement speed is halved.            |
| 7   | Hearing high-pitched ringing. Disadvantage on Perception (hearing). |
| 8   | Sudden lactose intolerance. Food-based spells fail.       |
| 9   | One hand becomes clammy and wet. Disadvantage on sleight of hand. |
| 10  | Mild but persistent nausea. Disadvantage on Constitution saves. |

Initially developed as an office prank by a rogue botanist-wizard, this spell became a controlled anomaly after an outbreak of contagious spoonerisms in Sector D.*

#### Surefooted Leap
*Cantrip Transmutation*
*Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 1 round 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Terrain 
**Terrain:** :: Catwalk

You attune your balance and momentum to the structural rhythm of your surroundings—metal beams, concrete ledges, scaffolding, and rooftop catwalks. For the briefest moment, the world feels designed for your movement.

Until the start of your next turn, your long jump distance is doubled, and you do not need a 10-foot run-up to make a long jump.

This movement ignores difficult terrain caused by uneven platforms, narrow ledges, or slippery surfaces, as long as they are part of a constructed or elevated structure (e.g., catwalks, fire escapes, scaffolding, or city rooftop obstacles).

Surefooted Leap is commonly used by urban druids, parkour enthusiasts, and rooftop messengers trained by nature itself. They move not like people, but like whispers on the wind—navigating a city’s skeleton with the grace of a climbing vine or the leap of a fox from rusted girder to bent pipe.
> 
> When this spell is cast, there’s a moment where gravity seems to wait—just long enough for you to leap farther than you should.*

#### Surveillance Blackout
*4th-level Divination*
*Wizard, Bard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a cracked camera lens)

You create an anomalous interference field that disrupts all surveillance and recording devices within range.
- Security cameras, sensors, and microphones malfunction, either looping old footage, displaying static, or going completely dark.
- Magical scrying attempts have disadvantage, as their feed becomes distorted and unreliable.
- Observers viewing the affected area remotely must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to recall what they saw.

 This spell does not grant invisibility but renders technological and magical observation highly unreliable.

---

#### Suspension of Disbelief
*1st-level Divination*
*Wizard, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 ft.
**Duration:** :: 1 hour (Concentration) 
**Components:** :: Verbal 

You briefly attune to the narrative fabric of reality, gaining an uncanny sensitivity to dramatic structure, clichés, and meta-patterns. For the duration, you can sense the presence of common story tropes in characters, environments, and events within range.

You can detect things like:
- When a villain is about to monologue
- If a side character radiates “tragic backstory energy”
- Whether a room feels “too conveniently empty”
- If an ancient prophecy is about to become relevant
- When someone is definitely about to betray the party

This insight is incredibly annoying to others. NPCs may roll Insight to feel disturbed by your overly convenient genre awareness.

Meta Mechanic (once per casting):

If the DM becomes visibly annoyed by your observations—subtly or overtly—you may “break the fourth wall.” When this happens:
- You may ask the DM one question about the current narrative, twist, or character.
- The DM must answer, but may do so cryptically.
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
- Your character forgets the answer consciously, but retains it subconsciously.
- The player gains one “narrative gut feeling” that can be invoked at any time for advantage on a single Insight, Perception, or Investigation check.

This ability can only be triggered once per casting.

Roleplay Guidance:- You might instinctively distrust someone because they “look like a redemption arc.”- You might refuse to read scrolls because “reading aloud always triggers curses.”- You might whisper “he’s the real villain” the moment you meet the king.

**Blood Pact:** Unique Offering You offered your past as part of the bargain—and now it isn’t entirely yours anymore.

Effect:
After the next long rest, the DM may change one detail about your character’s backstory.
You are aware that something has changed, but you don’t know what.

This change:
- Is permanent (unless changed again by future rests or spells)
- Can be minor or major (a name, a location, a relationship, a memory)
- This change is canon and ripples into the world.
- You can sense that something changed, but not what unless you investigate it.

You might feel déjà vu, confusion, strange memories, inconsistencies, or subtle emotional dissonance—but reality accepts the change without question.

#### Synaptic Reset
*6th-level Enchantment*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a lightning-infused crystal)

You generate a controlled bioelectric discharge that resets all neurological activity, eliminating unwanted effects.

- Removes all mind-affecting conditions, including Fear, Confusion, Domination, and Mental Overload.
- If the target has been altered by an anomaly or corporate augmentation, they may make a Constitution saving throw to resist its influence for 1 hour.
- If used on an unwilling target, they must make a Constitution saving throw or become Stunned for 1 minute.

---

#### System Breach
*5th-level Transmutation*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a broken firewall key)

You touch a wall, vault, or reinforced door, rewriting its properties to allow passage.
- Solid matter bends away from you, creating a 10-foot tunnel through any non-magical material.
- If the surface is reinforced or warded, make an Arcana check (DC 20) to bypass it.
- The tunnel remains until the spell ends.

---

#### System Reboot
*7th-level Enchantment*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a shattered data drive)

You reset the target’s physical and mental state. They remove all levels of exhaustion, regain 50 hit points, and end one curse, disease, or madness. However, they forget the last hour of their memories.

---

#### Tactical Enhancement Protocol
*2nd-level Abjuration*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a data uplink or HUD visor)

You optimize a creature’s response time. The target’s speed doubles, they gain a +2 bonus to AC, have advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and gain an additional action on each turn (Attack, Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object). When the spell ends, the target is unable to move or take actions for one round due to neural lag.

---

#### Taunt the Fruit Boots
*1st-level Enchantment*
*Bard, Ranger*

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
**Casting Time:** :: 1 minute
**Range:**        :: 120 ft.
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 
**Cost:** :: A skateboard

You channel your arcane energy into pure style and physics-defying balance. As part of the spell, you perform an absolutely sick trick on a skateboard (or any similar personal transport device). The trick defies gravity, logic, and taste. Everyone nearby feels its impact.

Roll a Performance (Charisma) check. Choose one of the following based on the result:- 15 or higher: A nearby crowd gathers. If 5 or more creatures visibly react with awe (DM’s discretion), you gain advantage on all Charisma checks and Charisma saving throws until your next long rest.- 10–14: The trick works, but only a few bystanders notice. You gain advantage on your next Charisma ability check.- Below 10: You still land it… barely. No benefit, but you avoid humiliation.

This spell grants no combat bonuses and immediately ends if cast in combat.

- NPC reactions can be determined by a group Insight check or DM fiat.- Impressing elite socialites, hardened criminals, or nobles may require a higher Performance DC.

#### Thallan's Consuming Lance
*7th-level Necromancy*
*Cleric, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Line/120 ft
**Duration:** :: up to 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Somatic 

You launch a pulse of cursed energy in a straight 120-foot line, lashing through all creatures in its path. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw.

- On a failure, the creature becomes Cursed by the Lance for the duration and takes 4d10 chiaric damage.  
- On a success, the creature takes half damage and is not cursed.

While Cursed by the Lance:
- If the creature dies, its body detonates in a burst of radiant decay, dealing 6d6 chiaric damage to all creatures within 10 feet.
- Any creature killed by this explosion while also under the curse triggers a new detonation, potentially chaining across the battlefield.
- Cursed creatures emit a faint hum of inverted sound, and their veins glow faintly with impossible colors.

At Higher Levels:  
When cast using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d10 for each level beyond 7th, and the explosion damage increases by 1d6.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher:  
A ghostly lance of light pierces the sky above you, flickering between real and not. For 1 round, you gain truesight in the direction the spell was cast.

> The rogue artificer Veyl Renshaw designed an enchanted device that could replicate Thallan's Consuming Lance. She activated it only once—her house was later found standing, but all its doors opened into an endless void.
> 
> To cast Thallan's Consuming Lance is to invite a presence that does not belong. The words taste of static, the gestures feel like echoes of hands not your own.*

#### Thallan's Flecks of Repugnant Soap
*4th-level Conjuration*
*Cleric, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self Sphere/20 ft
**Duration:** :: nan 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Material (powdered mortar)

You cast a handful of impossibly dry, crumbling soap into the air. It dissolves mid-flight, releasing microscopic flecks of cleansing hatred that scour body, soul, and shame alike.

Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 11d4 biologic damage as the soap sears away impurities—real or imagined—with unrelenting force. On a successful save, they take half damage.
- Affected creatures are coated in a stinging residue for 1 minute. During this time, they emit a foul, antiseptic stench, suffer disadvantage on Charisma checks, and cannot benefit from healing spells unless they succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the start of their turn.
- Creatures without skin (undead, constructs, oozes) are immune to this spell.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher: Reality trembles slightly. One creature hit by the spell experiences a childhood memory of being forcefully scrubbed clean, even if they never had one.

#### Thallan's Hand of Craven Opal
*4th-level Evocation*
*Wizard, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: nan 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Material (powdered goat horn)

You call upon the maddening echoes of the Craven Opal, forcing the minds of your enemies to grasp fragments of truths too vast to bear. Choose up to three creatures within range. Each must make an Intelligence saving throw.- On a failure, a creature takes 5d8 cognitive damage and becomes Distracted (disadvantage on Intelligence and Wisdom checks) until the end of its next turn.- On a success, it takes half damage and suffers no other effect.

While concentrating on this spell, you may use your action on subsequent turns to target the same or different creatures within range (up to three again). Each new wave of insight echoes the original effect—forcing a new save, new damage, and new Distracted effects.

When cast using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When you cast this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher, you hear your own name whispered backwards. Make an Intelligence saving throw (DC 15). On a failure, you are Stunned until the end of your next turn as impossible knowledge surges through your mind.

Thallan was a scholar obsessed with knowledge not meant for mortals. When he finally beheld the Eye of the Craven Opal, his mind shattered, and his thoughts scattered into the void. Now, his name lingers in whispers, carried by unseen hands that claw at the minds of those who dare to reach for forbidden truths.
> 
> Legend says that Thallan's Hand of Craven Opal was first cast by the exiled wizard Iosephine Blackquill, who sought to trap a god within a single word. The spell succeeded—but the god did not remain silent for long.
> 
> The ancients who first uttered Thallan's Hand of Craven Opal did not record its effects, only their warnings: 'It does not unmake. It remembers. And it will remember you, too.'*

#### Thallan's Saffron Truth
*7th-level Abjuration*
*Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self 15 ft radius
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (crushed eggshells)

You conjure an arcane seal of forgotten syllables—a 15-foot-radius circle inscribed with runes that shimmer like powdered saffron. The circle centers on you and moves with you. For the duration:

- **Allied creatures within the circle** gain a **+5 bonus to damage** on all weapon and spell attacks **targeting enemies outside the circle**. This damage is **impact** type and manifests as reverberating glyphs striking in tandem with the blow.  
- If this spell was cast using **your final remaining spell slot**, this bonus increases to **+10**, and the runes emit a low harmonic tone audible only to allies.  
- **Enemies who enter or begin their turn within the circle** must succeed on a **Charisma saving throw** or suffer **disadvantage on all melee attacks** until the start of their next turn.  
- Any creature **affected by a Condition** (such as Paranoid, Compelled, or Frightened) takes an **additional 1d6 cognitive damage** when hit by attacks made from within the circle.

**At Higher Levels:**  
When cast with a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the radius increases by 5 feet per level, and the cognitive damage increases by 1d6 for each level above 7th.

**Anomaly Effect:**
_When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher:_  
_A shimmering sigil appears in the air above the circle. While it remains (1 round), all critical hits made from inside the circle deal maximum damage._

Legend says that Thallan's Saffron Truth was first cast by the exiled wizard Iosephine Blackquill, who sought to trap a god within a single word. The spell succeeded—but the god did not remain silent for long.
> 
> The ancients who first uttered Thallan's Saffron Truth did not record its effects, only their warnings: 'It does not unmake. It remembers. And it will remember you, too.'*

#### Thaumaturgic Firewall
*5th-level Evocation*
*Wizard, Cleric*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a burned-out hard drive)

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
- Any creature attempting to teleport, phase shift, or enter the area via extradimensional travel must succeed on a Charisma saving throw.
- On a failed save, they are forcibly bounced back to their point of origin and take 4d6 void damage as the firewall briefly stabilizes their reality—violently.
- Creatures that attempt to cross into the firewall without magical travel feel a pressure in the air but suffer no immediate effect unless the area is layered with other wards.
- The firewall emits a low-frequency pulse only detectable to those attuned to arcane signals. To most, it appears as empty space.

Firewall protocols were originally adapted from Thaumatech incident logs and reverse-engineered from a failed dimensional quarantine. The area is considered mildly anomalous during the spell’s duration.*

---

#### Thaumaturgic Relay
*3rd-level Enchantment*
*Wizard, Bard, Cleric*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 120 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a twisted copper wire)

You convert arcane energy into an analog signal, allowing you to transmit a spoken message or magical effect through radio waves, telegraph lines, or wired technology. Spells like *Ciphered Message* and *sending* can be cast across vast distances if a signal relay exists.

---

#### The Backdoor
*6th-level Enchantment*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self (1 mile)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a key that no longer fits any lock)

You step through an unseen access point and reappear inside any place you have entered before, such as a locked building, hidden room, or secured facility.

---

#### The Bleeding Contract
*6th-level Necromancy*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 hour
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Permanent (until terms are fulfilled) 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a quill, blood, and a binding sigil)

You draft a supernatural contract, binding the signee to a deal they cannot escape—either willingly or through legal loopholes within reality itself.
 
- The contract must specify clear, finite terms (e.g., “deliver the encrypted drive,” “never disclose my presence,” “report back monthly”).  
- A creature may willingly sign the contract or be coerced through a failed Wisdom saving throw.
- If the signee violates the terms, they begin to hemorrhage lifeforce, suffering 1d6 bleeding damage per hour until the contract is honored or the caster dissolves it.
- The contract cannot be undone by mundane means. It can only be nullified through a corporate tribunal, anomaly override, or higher-order reality arbitration.

If the contract is poorly worded or vague, it will self-interpret using its own logic, often to the caster’s detriment. Corporate legal departments recommend all terms be double-verified before casting.

**Anomaly Effect:**
- If poorly worded, the contract may self-interpret, leading to unintended consequences that the caster did not foresee.

#### The Crawling Hunger
*4th-level Necromancy*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: Permanent (until satiated) 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a shard of gnawed bone)

You place a consuming need inside a creature, but it is not hunger for food—it is for something worse.
 
- The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they develop an insatiable hunger for a specific, forbidden thing, chosen randomly from the list below:
 
- The hunger cannot be resisted forever—every 24 hours without consuming the object, they take 2d6 cognitive damage.
- If they give in, they feel no satisfaction, only greater hunger.

|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Flesh of the Living – The target craves human flesh. They can resist, but only barely.                                                                 |
| 2    | Dead Voices – The target wants to chew on books, scrolls, and paper, consuming knowledge instead of food.                                              |
| 3    | Their Own Body – The target begins biting and gnawing at their own hands, arms, and lips when no one is looking.                                         |
| 4    | Glass and Metal – They find themselves chewing on shards of glass and rusted nails, feeling neither pain nor damage—but never satisfaction.             |
| 5    | Forgotten Names – The target whispers the names of those who have been erased from history, consuming their legacies with each repetition.              |
| 6    | Shadows – They try to eat lightless spaces, their mouth opening wider than it should when they stand in darkness.                                          |

**Anomaly Effect:**
- If multiple creatures are cursed in the same location, they begin to crave each other, driven to a shared consumption.

#### The Hollow Man’s Smile
*3rd-level Enchantment*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 1 hour 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a mask that has never been worn)

You conjure an unnerving mask over your face, obscuring your true identity.

- You gain advantage on Deception checks, but all social interactions become deeply unsettling.
- Creatures who see you for more than 1 minute must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 15) or develop a deep fear of you for the next 24 hours.

#### The Infinite Stare
*4th-level Divination*
*Paladin, Sorcerer, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet Single target
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic (A perfectly round marble)

Your eyes become vessels of an unknowable force—an unblinking, paradoxical void that reflects nothing and sees everything. You focus this unnatural stare on a single creature within range.

The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or become Obsessed with your gaze. While obsessed, the creature:- Cannot avert its eyes from you and cannot willingly move more than 30 feet away.- Suffers disadvantage on Wisdom and Intelligence checks and saving throws as its thoughts loop in recursive terror.- Takes 2d6 cognitive damage at the start of each of its turns as your gaze frays its mental barriers.

The creature may attempt another saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the effect ends.

At Higher Levels.
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each level beyond 4th. At 6th level and above, the creature is also Frightened of you for the first round after failing.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher:
Your eyes glow with ink-black light, and any creature that can see you must make a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to lie until the start of your next turn.

The Veil Market traders whisper of an artifact that contains The Infinite Stare—a single black page that cannot be burned, torn, or marked. Those who read it vanish, leaving behind only the scent of ink and decay.
> 
> The Elders of the Concord Spire refuse to acknowledge The Infinite Stare, calling it 'a mistake in the fabric of the world.' Yet, the forbidden archives tell another story.*

#### The Jester's Wild Gambit
*3rd-level Enchantment*
*Paladin, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (A playing card dipped in blood)

Chaos hangs in the air, swirling with possibilities. You embrace the whimsy of chance, drawing power from fate’s unpredictable nature.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
When you cast The Jester’s Wild Gambit, you surrender yourself to fate’s hands. Every time you make an attack roll or ability check, you may roll twice, taking the higher result. On a natural 20, the effect is magnified—doubling the result of your roll. But on a natural 1, something chaotic occurs. The DM may choose an unpredictable effect, such as disadvantage on your next roll, an unintended event that causes a distraction, or a minor but inconvenient consequence.

At 5th level, fate’s unpredictability expands. You may force one enemy within 10 feet of you to reroll a successful saving throw once per turn, manifesting the whims of fortune upon your foes.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a roll of 15 or higher, you feel a slight disturbance in reality, as though an unseen force shifts in your favor. The outcome may feel more certain, but a lingering ripple remains in the air.

Legend says that The Jester's Wild Gambit was first cast by the exiled wizard Iosephine Blackquill, who sought to trap a god within a single word. The spell succeeded—but the god did not remain silent for long.
> 
> The ancients who first uttered The Jester's Wild Gambit did not record its effects, only their warnings: 'It does not unmake. It remembers. And it will remember you, too.'*

#### The Maw That Hungers
*7th-level Necromancy*
*Wizard, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self (30-foot radius)
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (A shard of bone gnawed by an unknown entity)

You conjure a vast, spectral maw beneath you—its jagged teeth grinding the threads of reality. The air trembles with a silent hunger, and all creatures of your choice within a **30-foot radius** must succeed on a **Constitution saving throw** or suffer the following effects:

- Their **maximum hit points are reduced by 3d10**. This reduction lasts until they complete a **long rest**.  
- They become **Frightened** of you until the end of your next turn.  
- Their **healing is halved** for the duration of the spell.

A creature that **fails this save by 10 or more** is also afflicted with the **Altered** condition for 1 minute, their features subtly reshaped by the hunger of the void.

While the spell is active, the ground pulses like a throat, and creatures who begin their turn within the area take **1d6 necrotic damage** as spectral teeth snap at their soul.

At 9th level, the radius increases to 60 feet.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher: Reality trembles slightly, causing a ripple that lingers unseen.

A beggar on the streets of Concord claims to have been a king before uttering the words of The Maw That Hungers. When asked for details, his mouth moves, but no sound emerges.
> 
> Some claim that The Maw That Hungers does not work the same way twice. The more one casts it, the more it adapts—learning, watching, waiting.*

#### The Mourner's Kiss
*1st-level Necromancy*
*Bard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic 

You infuse the Veins of Lament into a kiss, channeling raw pain through the moment of contact. When you touch a creature with your lips (or simulate the act with a somatic gesture), your magic delivers a pulse of internal anguish.

The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d3 chiaric damage plus 3 damage per caster level (maximum 1d3 + 20). On a successful save, the creature takes half damage.

This kiss leaves no visible wound, but the target feels as if something delicate within them cracked.

Practiced in secret by jaded lovers, dark poets, and those who trade beauty for brutality, the Kiss of Wounding is both a spell and a statement.*

---

#### The Price of Names
*5th-level Enchantment*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 minute
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 week 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a legal document dissolving the target’s identity, signed in willing blood)
**Acquisition Note:** :: True name etchings must be obtained through sanctioned rites or eldritch brokers.

You strip power from a target’s true name, making them vulnerable.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
- The target has disadvantage on all saving throws against effects that explicitly name them in their casting, inscription, or invocation (such as through a name spoken aloud, signed in a document, or used in a ritual).
- Any creature who speaks the target’s name aloud can sense the direction (not exact location) of the target within 1 mile, provided the target is on the same plane.
- This effect ends if the name is burned, rewritten, legally nullified, or exchanged through sanctioned rites (as negotiated through an A.S.T.R.A.L. broker or similar agent).

**Blood Pact:** True Name Etching

#### The Spear of Forgotten Kings
*7th-level Necromancy*
*Warlock, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch Line (120 feet)
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (A rusted crown from a long-dead ruler)

You conjure a colossal spectral spear—a jagged relic made from the reigns of long-erased monarchs and the regrets that bound them. The spear surges forward in a straight line up to 120 feet long and 5 feet wide.

All creatures in the area must make a **Constitution saving throw**. On a failure, a creature takes **6d10 chiaric damage**. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell has its **soul torn from memory and imprisoned** within a spectral throne—unable to be resurrected or contacted by any means short of a *Wish* or *Sovereign Accord*.

**Success:** A creature takes half damage and is not affected by the soul imprisonment effect.

**While affected by this spell:**
- The area traversed by the spear echoes faintly with overlapping royal decrees in unknown tongues.  
- Any creature standing within 10 feet of the line for the next minute suffers **disadvantage on Charisma checks**, as their voice seems small and forgotten.  
- You may sense the presence of monarchic or noble bloodlines within range for 1 round, as they resonate with the spear’s memory.

**At Higher Levels.**  
When cast with a **9th-level spell slot**:
- The damage increases to **8d10 chiaric**.
- You may designate up to **two lines** extending from you in separate directions.
- Any creature slain by this spell also causes one creature of your choice within 30 feet to become **Frightened** of you for 1 minute (Wisdom save negates).

The Veil Market traders whisper of an artifact that contains The Spear of Forgotten Kings—a single black page that cannot be burned, torn, or marked. Those who read it vanish, leaving behind only the scent of ink and decay.

**Anomaly Effect:**
_When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher:_  
_A ghostly coronation takes place in silence at the end of the line—an echo of an ancient ruler briefly manifesting. All who see it must succeed a **DC 15 Wisdom saving throw** or fall **prone in reverence or horror**._

**Blood Pact:** Offering of Self

#### The Specter’s Invitation
*8th-level Necromancy*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 hour
**Range:**        :: 1 mile
**Duration:** :: 24 hours 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a candle made from human tallow, burned over the target’s unburied remains)
**Acquisition Note:** :: True Name Etchings are highly dangerous and must be carved into the spirit’s remains before summoning. Without both a Blood Pact and True Name Etching, the spirit returns malformed, vengeful, or hollow.

You invite a spirit back into the world of the living, but only for a limited time.
 
- The summoned spirit returns in physical form for 24 hours.
- They remember everything from their death and are aware that this is temporary.
- At the end of the spell’s duration, the spirit knows who summoned them—and may not be happy about it.

**Blood Pact:** True Name Etching

#### The Ticking Man’s Favor
*4th-level Enchantment*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 minute
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: 24 hours 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a pocket watch with no hands)

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
You grant a creature the blessing of the Ticking Man, a timeless entity whose debts must always be paid.

- The target gains +1 to AC and saving throws while the spell is active.
- At any time within 24 hours, the Ticking Man may call in the favor, forcing the target to perform one action or request, no matter the cost.
- If the request is refused, the target immediately ages 2d20 years and loses the benefits of the spell.

#### Thermal Discontinuity
*6th-level Evocation*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 ft
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Material, Somatic, Verbal (a cracked thermos lid)

You rupture the thermal equilibrium of a target, causing heat to violently evacuate their body into the surrounding air. Choose one creature within range.
        •        The target must make a Constitution saving throw.
        •        On a failure, it takes 5d10 cold damage and suffers disadvantage on its next weapon attack, as its limbs go numb and rigid.
        •        On a success, it takes half damage and suffers no further effects.

If the target is touching metal or standing on a conductive surface, all creatures within 10 feet of it also take 1d6 cold damage from the thermal backlash.

---

#### Tight
*2nd-level Transmutation*
*Bard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic 

With a sharp pose and a surge of magic, you conjure a flawless fit. The target’s attire realigns into immaculate tailoring—custom, luxurious, and sharp as their mood.
- While affected, the target:
- Gains advantage on Charisma (Performance, Intimidation, or Persuasion) checks made to impress, seduce, or intimidate.
- Radiates undeniable confidence and poise.
- Exudes a faint supernatural polish—fabric shimmers, collars hold, and hems never fold.

When cast on an unwilling creature, they must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or:
- Their clothing constricts for a moment, imposing disadvantage on their next Strength or Dexterity-based check or save.
- They suffer 1d4 cognitive damage from the sudden discomfort and embarrassment.

At Higher Levels:
If cast using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the outfit is also instantly cleaned, mended, and altered into any cut, color, or fashion style desired—from tactical opera-wear to battlefield haute couture.

In Concord City, it’s often used in high-fashion duels and rogue theater circles.- Casting Tight before a date or duel is considered polite.*

#### Tile Pulse
*Cantrip Evocation*
*Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30ft
**Duration:** :: Instant 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Terrain 
**Terrain:** :: Veined Stone

You attune yourself to the fractured lifeblood of the city—cracks in pavement, broken tiles, and splintered stone—awakening the pulse beneath the ground.

You stomp or strike the ground, and a violent pulse of force erupts outward from a fractured surface within range. The magic seeks instability, targeting seams and breaks to launch razor-sharp shards in all directions.

Choose a point on the ground within 30 feet that contains fractured terrain (e.g., cracked concrete, shattered tile, weathered brick). All creatures within 5 feet of that point must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 impact damage as they are struck by magically propelled debris. On a success, they take no damage.

---

#### Time-Locked Asset
*8th-level Conjuration*
*Wizard, Cleric*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 hour 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a corporate time-freeze contract, sealed within a wristwatch stuck at midnight)
**Acquisition Note:** :: Corporate contracts must be notarized and signed before casting.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
You place an object, structure, or creature into a localized time stasis. It becomes immune to damage, aging, and movement, as if frozen in time. Attempts to interact with it fail as if it were an illusion.

**Arcane Strain:**
Freezing a sentient entity in time induces Moderate Arcane Strain.

#### Tortak's Siphon of Haunting Moss
*7th-level Necromancy*
*Wizard, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch Sphere/15 ft
**Duration:** :: nan 
**Components:** :: Material (a small wax candle)

You release a parasitic curse woven from the hunger of haunted moss. Choose a point within range. Any number of creatures within a **15-foot-radius sphere** centered on that point must make a **Constitution saving throw**.

On a failed save:
- For the duration, the next **45 hit points** of healing the target would receive are **stolen**. Instead of regaining hit points, **you regain that amount instead**, and the target receives nothing.
- Each time this transfer occurs, spectral moss visibly spreads along the target’s skin or clothing.
- While affected, targets have **disadvantage on Constitution saving throws** to maintain concentration on spells.

On a success:
- The creature is unaffected, but faint lichen-like patterns momentarily crawl across their skin before vanishing.

**The spell ends early** for a creature when it has had **45 HP of healing siphoned**, when it drops to 0 hit points, or if you lose concentration.

**At Higher Levels.**  
When cast using a **9th-level spell slot**:
- The siphon cap increases to **90 hit points** per target.  
- You may choose **up to two separate areas** to apply this effect simultaneously (each requiring concentration to be maintained independently).

**Anomaly Effect:**
_When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher:_  
_A spectral overgrowth of bioluminescent moss blooms within the area. All creatures inside the sphere must succeed on a **DC 15 Wisdom saving throw** or be **frightened** of you until the start of your next turn._

> _“They say the moss grows where the dead still think of life—and that Tortak found a way to make it drink instead.”_  
> > — Folk saying, forbidden in Concord’s inner districts*

#### Toxic Stray
*2nd-level Transmutation*
*Druid, Sorcerer*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 ft.
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

You gesture toward a nearby stray creature—be it a cat, pigeon, squirrel, rat, or even a raccoon—and imbue it with trace amounts of venomous energy. For the duration, the creature becomes semi-magical and mildly dangerous in unpredictable ways.- Choose or roll for a nearby unclaimed beast CR 0 or lower within range.- That creature becomes your semi-loyal venomous companion for the spell’s duration.- The creature cannot speak, but it understands your intent and can take basic commands (such as “harass,” “follow,” or “bite”).

While venomous, it gains:- A bite or claw attack that deals 1d6 toxic damage in addition to normal damage.- Creatures damaged by it must succeed a Constitution saving throw or suffer disadvantage on their next attack roll or skill check (your choice).

If reduced to 0 HP or dismissed, it explodes in a puff of neon-green spores and glittery hair, imposing disadvantage on Perception checks in a 5-ft radius until the end of the turn.

| d6 | Quirk While Poisoned                                                |
|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | It glows faintly green and refuses to blink.                        |
| 2  | It purrs aggressively when attacking.                               |
| 3  | Its venom smells like bubblegum.                                    |
| 4  | It sings very faint lullabies only the caster can hear.            |
| 5  | It develops a temporary monocle.                                    |
| 6  | It explodes into confetti upon vanishing.                          |

This spell is commonly used by street witches, dumpster mystics, and one particularly infamous pastry chef in Neon Mire.*

#### Tremor Sign
*Cantrip Enchantment*
*Druid, Sorcerer*

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Material (a piece of cracked stone)

You tap the ground, sending a ripple of energy through the surface. A creature standing on solid ground within range must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or momentarily lose balance, forcing it to make its next attack roll or Dexterity check with disadvantage. If the terrain is loose or unstable, the effect is automatically successful.

#### Truth Between the Sheets
*1st-level Divination*
*Bard, Wizard, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal, Material (a shard of polished obsidian kissed once, a rose petal burned to ash, and a silk ribbon tied and untied around a drop of honeyed wine)

You exhale a slow, intoxicating breath, sending whispers of carnal truth and romantic echoes drifting into the target’s aura. The magic doesn’t extract facts—it invites revelation.

A silken mirage unfolds, where the subject’s soul steps forward, cloaked in glimmering honesty. Faces, forms, emotions, and gestures emerge from the haze—some familiar, some unknown—each representing a truth they’ve always carried.

The spell may reveal one or more of the following aspects, depending on your focus:

Gender Identity: The target's inner identity manifests briefly as a mirage, affirming their true self. This may reveal identities such as Male, Female, Nonbinary, Transgender, Cisgender, Two-Spirit, Genderfluid, Agender, or something uniquely personal and beyond typical categories.

Romantic Inclination: You awaken a subtle echo within the target’s spirit, reflecting their romantic nature. This might indicate whether they identify as Hyper-Romantic, Romantic, Demi-Romantic, Grayromantic, Aromantic, or something entirely undefined.

Sexual Orientation: A fleeting, sensory dreamscape gently unfolds around the target, reflecting their deepest attractions. They may acknowledge, embrace, or gently dismiss these visions. The spell doesn't impose new desires; it simply illuminates those already present.

Position Preference: A subtle sensation reveals the subject's preferred intimacy position, such as Top, Bottom, Versatile, Vers-Top, Vers-Bottom, Side, or an unclassified, uniquely personal preference.

Fetish Affinity: A delicate hum pulses into the subject’s subconscious, drawing forth hidden motifs of pleasure—those they cherish, those they deny, and those that whisper only in dreams. This may reveal affinities such as Bondage, Impact Play, Sensory Deprivation, Exhibitionism, Voyeurism, Power Exchange, Pet Play, or something undocumented by common texts.

Kink Role Alignment: A soft whisper coils through the subject’s awareness, coaxing insight into their innate position within dominance-submission dynamics. They may momentarily experience themselves in a state of control, surrender, or fluidity. Whether they resist, acknowledge, or embrace this vision, the spell merely opens a door—it does not push them through it.

The experience is not invasive—it is affirming, deeply personal, and laced with quiet reverence. The subject may resist this unveiling with a Wisdom saving throw; on a success, the vision remains fragmented, and only a vague sense of their essence slips through.

This spell does not coerce. It does not judge. It simply illuminates what was already burning softly beneath the surface.

This spell respects the target's autonomy and does not alter or coerce identities or preferences; it merely reveals truths already held.

Always ensure sensitive handling of these revelations at your table, prioritizing player comfort and respectful roleplay.

#### Tweak/Goose
*Cantrip Transmutation*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

A pulse of low-frequency nerve stimulation targets a muscle group or sensitive area, triggering a sharp jolt of sensation akin to a goosebump-inducing touch.

- The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or experience an involuntary twitch, shiver, or sharp intake of breath, losing their next reaction.

This spell is often misused in underground establishments, enhancing paid experiences or delivering unexpected sensations.

#### Unauthorized Spatial Breach
*5th-level Conjuration*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a corrupted A.S.T.R.A.L. passcode)

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
You forcefully tear open a 30-foot-wide unstable rift between your location and another point you can see within range. This portal remains open for the duration or until your concentration is broken.

- Any creature may step through the rift as a movement action, arriving instantly at the destination point.
- Creatures must return through the same rift before the spell ends. If they do not, they are trapped between unstable dimensional layers.

> While trapped:
- Affected creatures cannot be targeted, located, or communicated with by any means.
- After 1d6 hours, they are forcibly ejected into the nearest safe, unoccupied space near the original destination.
- Upon return, they suffer 3d10 distortive damage from temporal and spatial disorientation.

If the caster ends the spell voluntarily or is incapacitated, the rift collapses immediately.

#### Unscheduled Maintenance
*2nd-level Enchantment*
*Bard, Wizard, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 hour 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a neon "CLOSED" sign)

A targeted building, passageway, or technological system becomes temporarily shut down for "repairs", creating an official-looking lockdown.
 
- Doors will not open, cameras cease recording, and security systems display a “DOWN FOR MAINTENANCE” error.
- Employees or passersby will subconsciously believe the closure is valid unless they succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence check.

**Anomaly Effect:**
- If cast too often, bureaucratic forces may send an actual maintenance crew, unknowingly reinforcing the spell.

---

#### Unseen Bureaucracy
*3rd-level Conjuration*
*Bard, Sorcerer*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self 60 ft.
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Material, Somatic, Verbal (A broken gear)

You summon an invisible bureaucratic entity that sternly demands all paperwork within the spell’s area (a single room or similarly sized space within range) be immediately filed in triplicate. The entity is invisible but can be clearly heard shuffling papers and making disapproving murmurs.

Effects:- No creature can willingly leave the affected area until the demanded paperwork has been successfully triplicated (takes approximately 1 minute per page per copy).- If no paperwork is present, the entity magically conjures a tedious stack of administrative forms to fill out, provided along with quills and ink.- If cast outdoors or in an open area, the entity first casts “Remote Office,” instantly teleporting all creatures within 60 feet to a small, featureless office space filled with paperwork and uncomfortable chairs. Creatures remain here until paperwork is filed or the spell ends.

Failure to comply results in the entity issuing an “official warning,” delivered ominously yet politely, which no one knows how to appeal or what consequences it may hold (DM discretion).

At Higher Levels:
When cast using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the paperwork increases exponentially, making escape progressively more difficult and tedious (triplicate at 4th-level, quadruplicate at 5th-level, etc.).

| d4 | Consequence of Non-Compliance                              |
|----|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | You receive a cryptic, ominous "Official Warning."         |
| 2  | Your name appears on a mysterious "watchlist."             |
| 3  | You owe inexplicable back taxes in a foreign city.         |
| 4  | The invisible entity sighs and mentions your "permanent record." |

**Range:**        :: 60 ft.
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

You align your body, mind, and bladder with an invisible thread of inevitability. For the duration, cosmic forces ensure your next strike is absurdly accurate—but only under strangely specific conditions.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
Until the spell ends, your next attack roll automatically hits a target of your choice if any of the following are true at the time of the attack:- You are actively urinating.- You are within 5 feet of someone who is.- You are standing inside a bathroom, restroom, washroom, or similarly designated facility—regardless of plumbing status.

If none of these conditions are true, you must spend an action miming the act of relieving yourself (DMs are encouraged to enforce social consequences) to activate the effect. Once the effect is used, the spell ends

When cast using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you may choose two attacks within the duration to benefit from this effect instead of one.

#### Utallash's Persuit of Ceramic
*3rd-level Transmutation*
*Cleric, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: BonusAction
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: nan 
**Components:** :: Material (currant leaves or a little vial of paint)

You invoke a forbidden remnant of ancient magic, drawing from the chilling legacy known as Utallash’s Pursuit of Ceramic. Choose one creature within range; it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target suffers the following effects:- The target takes 4d8 distortive damage as their identity begins to fracture, leaving a hollow, ceramic-like resonance within their being.- They become a “Husk”: For the next hour, the target struggles to remember their own name, imposing disadvantage on all Charisma-based checks and saving throws.

Marked by the Void (Caster’s Consequences):
Every time you cast this spell, you become subtly marked by the magic. The mark grows stronger with repeated uses. You experience minor, unsettling phenomena:- Your reflection occasionally blinks or moves independently.- Your shadow periodically misaligns or lags behind your physical form.

After you cast this spell 3 or more times, you gain disadvantage on Charisma saving throws until you complete a long rest, as the magic slowly erodes your own identity.

These effects are cumulative but subtle enough to be hidden from casual observers—though those familiar with the Void’s whispers will recognize your affliction immediately.

Removing the Mark:
A Greater Restoration or similarly potent cleansing magic removes all accumulated marks from you, resetting the count.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher: Reality trembles slightly, causing a ripple that lingers unseen.

Something unknown has touched this magic, leaving behind traces of those who have cast it before.
> 
> During the Calamity of Shrouded Stars, Utallash's Persuit of Ceramic was unleashed upon a battlefield, reducing an entire legion to nameless husks. Those who survived swore they heard their own names whispered by the void.*

#### Veilborn Glimmer
*Cantrip Enchantment*
*Bard, Wizard, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

Your body shimmers with ethereal light, briefly phasing between reality and the unknown. For the duration, you can dim or brighten your own appearance at will, causing yourself to glow faintly (shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius) or become shadowed (light sources within 10 feet of you appear dimmer). This effect ends if you fall unconscious or dismiss it as a bonus action.

#### Veins of the Forgotten
*3rd-level Necromancy*
*Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a drop of your own blood, mixed with ink)

You allow your veins to forget their purpose, turning your circulatory system into something liquid, shifting, and unknowable.

- For the duration of the spell, your blood is no longer entirely inside you—it slithers beneath your skin, forming moving patterns, and drips onto the floor in places you haven't stepped.
- You gain the following benefits and consequences:
- Your body is semi-fluid, allowing you to squeeze through gaps no wider than 1 inch.
- You are immune to poison and diseases, as your blood is no longer organic.
- You take half damage from slashing attacks, but piercing attacks deal double damage as your body cannot hold shape properly.
- Each time you cast a spell, your blood reacts violently, causing you to lose 1d6 HP per spell level.
- If you reach 0 HP while this spell is active, you do not die—instead, your blood scatters across the room, and your body must be reassembled manually.
 
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

 Anomaly Effect:
- If used too frequently, your blood refuses to return to your body, forming an independent entity that watches you, waiting for an opportunity to replace you.

#### Velvet Undress
*3rd-level Enchantment*
*Bard*

**Casting Time:** :: Variable
**Range:**        :: 10 yards
**Duration:** :: Special 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Material (an article of clothing to be removed)

With a deliberate and hypnotic performance, you begin a sensual dance designed to captivate a single creature of your choice within range. As part of the performance, you must remove one article of clothing per round. Each round the dance continues:- The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, suffering a –1 penalty for each round you’ve maintained the dance.- On a failed save, the target becomes Charmed and fully fixated on your every movement, unable to willingly look away or take hostile actions against you for the duration.- If the target is already Charmed by you when this spell is cast, the duration extends by 1 additional minute.

The spell ends early if the caster is interrupted, breaks concentration, or voluntarily stops dancing.

**Blood Pact:** Pleasure Numbing

“Influence consultants” claim this spell’s real magic lies not in the removal of garments, but in the power of anticipation.*

#### Verdant Irony
*2nd-level Transmutation*
*Druid, Bard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: self 30 ft. radius
**Duration:** :: 1 Hour 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal, Material (a small piece of lichen or moss)

You ironically invoke nature in the concrete-dominated Concord City, spontaneously causing lichen and moss to rapidly grow and spread in a 30-foot radius around you, covering surfaces and structures alike.

Choose one creature within range (including yourself). If the target is willing, it gains a friendly affinity with this newly grown environment: the lichen subtly helps them navigate and move effortlessly, granting them advantage on Dexterity checks within the area.

An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed by the aggressive lichen growth, which actively attempts to hinder and trip them, imposing disadvantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws within the affected area.

The effect lasts for up to 1 hour or until dispelled.

Additionally, while within the area of the spell, affected creatures occasionally notice flickering glimpses of a serene, lush, and seemingly para-dimensional park hidden within reality. They never fully access this realm, experiencing only a tantalizing vision of what Concord City might have been.

A heavily censored A.S.T.R.A.L. document refers cryptically to experiments involving “environmental stabilization anomalies,” mentioning a phenomenon that “defied categorization—neither boon nor curse—but rewrote fate itself.”*

#### Verdant Renewal
*Cantrip Abjuration*
*Druid*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Terrain 
**Terrain:** :: Moss-Covered Pavement

You touch a patch of resilient green—be it moss growing through cracked pavement or ivy clinging to concrete—and draw strength from its quiet persistence.

Upon casting this spell, a subtle green glow briefly pulses around your feet and chest. For the next minute:- You gain resistance to poison damage.- You have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to resist or recover from exhaustion.

This effect represents the restorative essence of hardy flora—clinging life that thrives in adversity, even in forgotten corners of the city.

Verdant Renewal is a hallmark cantrip of druids who walk the forgotten arteries of modern sprawl—those who find nature not in forests, but in the weeds in gutters, moss in subways, and roots beneath asphalt. These druids believe resilience is nature’s truest gift—and draw upon it to steady their own breath in moments of fatigue and illness.*

#### Verdict of the Forgotten
*6th-level Necromancy*
{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a relic of an erased historical figure)

You invoke a judgment long forgotten, compelling reality itself to erase the target. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they take 10d10 chiaric damage, and all creatures within 30 feet must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.

If the target is reduced to 0 HP by this spell, their body disintegrates into nothing, and their existence is stricken from minor recorded history (casual memories fade, but deep records remain).

 At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 per slot level above 6th.

#### Viral Purge
*6th-level Enchantment*
*Cleric, Druid, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a vial of antiviral serum)

All creatures in range are cured of diseases, infections, and parasitic infestations. If a creature is actively

 suffering from a necrotic or viral-based curse, this spell grants advantage on saving throws against it for the next 24 hours.

---

#### Vital Override
*3rd-level Enchantment*
*Cleric, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a defibrillator or mechanical equivalent)

You restore a creature to life, provided it has been dead for no longer than 1 minute. The creature returns with 1 hit point, but its body bears an unnatural stiffness, as if something is keeping it running rather than fully reviving it. Until they complete a long rest, they gain one level of exhaustion.

---

#### Vital Threshold
*2nd-level Conjuration*
*Cleric, Bard, Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: up to 1 minute 
**Components:** :: nan 

You conjure a glowing arcane wall in a space you can see within range. The wall forms a shimmering force field up to 10 feet wide, 10 feet tall, and 1 foot thick. When you cast the spell, choose one creature type (such as Humanoid, Undead, Construct, Beast, etc.).

For the duration:- When a creature of the chosen type passes through the wall, it regains 1d6 hit points and gains temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.- When a creature of any other type passes through the wall, it takes 2d6 necrotic damage.

Each creature can only pass through the wall once per round.

After a creature passes through the wall (regardless of type), it becomes solid, preventing further passage by that creature or others for the rest of the round. At the start of your next turn, it becomes intangible again, ready for another passage.

The wall is automatically dispelled after a number of total passages (of any type) equal to your caster level.

At Higher Levels.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the wall is 10 feet wider for each slot level above 2nd

The light hum of the wall pulses like a heartbeat. Passing through feels like walking through sunlight after rain — warm, clear, and briefly perfect.*

#### Vow of Erasure
*9th-level Necromancy*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Permanent 
**Components:** :: Somatic 

You press your lips to the target’s skin—cheek, brow, hand, or lips. They do not cry out. They do not resist. There is no flash of light, no scream, no struggle.

There is only absence.- A creature with 150 hit points or fewer instantly dies.- After 1d10 rounds, their body crumbles into dust, leaving no corpse, no remains, and no residue.- They cannot be resurrected by any means—not by Wish, True Resurrection, or divine intervention. Their soul is simply gone, erased from all known realms.- Creatures immune to necrotic damage or undeath are not immune to this spell. It bypasses resistance and death saves.

#### Wall of Farce
*1st-level Conjuration*
*Cleric, Bard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

You conjure an illusory wall up to 5 feet wide, 10 feet tall, and 1 inch thick made entirely of bad visual gags and slapstick nonsense. Rubber chickens, cream pies, banana peels, and invisible panes of glass loop endlessly in magical animation. The wall occasionally emits groan-worthy puns, honking horns, or laugh tracks from nowhere.

The wall is not solid and can be walked through—but creatures who approach it often don’t realize it’s fake.

When a creature comes within 5 feet of the wall for the first time on a turn or starts its turn near it, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become incapacitated with uncontrollable laughter until the start of its next turn.

A creature that investigates the wall (as an action) may make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, it sees through the illusion—the wall disappears for that creature only.

The spell ends early if you lose concentration or dismiss it.

Originally created by court jesters-turned-clerics as divine protest theater. Still banned in several religious institutions due to a pie-related incident during communion.*

#### Wallflower Perk
*2nd-level Illusion*
*Paladin*

**Casting Time:** :: Reaction (when a spell is cast nearby)
**Range:**        :: 30 ft.
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

When a spell is cast nearby, you instinctively deflect attention by projecting a spectral version of yourself into a nearby corner. The illusory duplicate radiates an aura of intense social discomfort, misdirecting attention away from you.

For the duration, creatures within 30 feet must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when they attempt to target you with an attack, spell, or ability. On a failure, they ignore you entirely, unable to focus on your presence unless you directly harm them or force a saving throw.

This is not invisibility—you remain visible, but socially unnoticeable in a way that feels wrong. Even allies may forget you’re present.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When you cast this spell, roll a d6 to determine a subtle anomaly that persists while the spell is active:
	1.	People ignore you, even if you scream.
	2.	Your voice echoes from the wrong direction.
	3.	Your reflection disappears in all mirrors.
	4.	Written text about you vanishes or becomes unreadable.
	5.	Animals refuse to come near you.
	6.	Anyone who sees you forgets details about your appearance within seconds.

A fragment of a partially erased A.S.T.R.A.L. log refers to this phenomenon as a “psycho-social misdirection glyph.” It notes one incident where an entire strike team entered a room, saw the caster, and left convinced it was unoccupied—twice.*

#### Wanton Assessment
*1st-level Divination*
*Bard, Cleric*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Material (a drop of honey)

You brush your fingers gently across the target’s skin, and for a moment, their body opens itself to your senses—like a lover whispering its deepest discomforts.

You detect any sexual or intimacy-related ailments currently affecting the creature, whether physical, psychological, emotional, or arcane. This includes but is not limited to:
- Venereal diseases, mundane or magical
- Hormonal imbalances, arousal anomalies, arcane sterility
- Psychological blocks, trauma-induced aversions, or compulsions
- Magically-induced attractions, false bonds, or enchantments
- Anomalous intimacy curses (e.g., “can’t touch anyone,” “always fall in love,” etc.)

Each issue is revealed in poetic, metaphorical terms, such as:

“The heart is sealed with wax,” or “There is a hunger with no source.”

With a DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine or Insight) check, you may interpret one affliction literally.

An afflicted creature feels a brief sensation of heat or shiver, depending on the nature of the ailment. Some report hearing a whisper from within themselves.

**Anomaly Effect:**
Some psychological conditions may emerge for the first time only after this spell is cast. These effects often manifest as soft compulsions or disturbing dreams.

#### Wardrobe Malfunction
*Cantrip Transmutation*
*Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Bonus Action
**Range:**        :: 15 feet
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

You remotely manipulate the fastenings of a creature’s outfit—zippers slip, laces untie, clasps flick open or shut, or corsets snap with whispered precision.
- You may don or doff any simple clothing as a bonus action, including on a willing creature within range.
- If cast on an unwilling creature, they must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have part of their clothing shift, loosen, or fall apart (purely cosmetic, unless specified).
- Subtle castings require a Wisdom (Insight) check against your spell save DC to notice the alteration.

At Higher Tiers:
- If the caster is level 5 or higher, the spell can affect light armor.
- At level 10, it can affect medium or heavy armor, but doing so requires a Strength (Athletics) check (DC 15) to undo or resecure the armor manually.

Scaling (At Higher Levels):
The spell’s damage increases when you reach higher levels:- 5th level: 2d6- 11th level: 3d6- 17th level: 4d6

Druids of the Concrete Vein speak of the city’s pulse as if it were a living thing. Where others see decay, they find breath. Vital Pulse is their heartbeat—an echo of nature breaking through the scars of civilization.*

#### Whispering Wine
*1st-level Conjuration*
*Bard, Cleric, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Duration:** :: Instantaneous 
**Components:** :: Verbal 

You conjure a bottle of smooth, dark wine that whispers strange, cryptic advice to anyone who drinks from it. The murmurs are soft, slurred, and often incoherent—but they always sound meaningful… even when they aren’t.

Each time a creature takes a sip (a free object interaction), they must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or accidentally reveal a personal secret aloud. The secret is chosen by the DM or the player, depending on tone.

The wine’s advice is usually:- Just slightly off-topic- Half-true at best- Or deeply unsettling with no context (“Beware the third fork…”)

At Higher Levels:
When cast using a 2nd-level slot or higher, you may conjure an additional bottle per level above 1st.

| d6 | The wine whispers...                        |
|----|---------------------------------------------|
| 1  | “Tell them about the socks.”                |
| 2  | “They already know. It’s too late.”         |
| 3  | “One of them isn’t who they say they are.”  |
| 4  | “Third moon. First hour. The bread arrives.”|
| 5  | “Confess. Confess. Confess.”                |
| 6  | *softly giggles for 6 seconds straight*     |

#### Wisp of the Forgotten
*Cantrip Necromancy*
*Bard, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Duration:** :: 1 minute 
**Components:** :: Somatic, Verbal 

You conjure a faint, ghostly whisper from beyond the veil, carrying an unintelligible but haunting message to a creature within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become unnerved until the start of its next turn, giving it disadvantage on the next Wisdom (Perception) check or initiative roll it makes. If the creature is already frightened, it takes cognitive damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

---

#### Witness of the Veil
*5th-level Enchantment*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Duration:** :: 10 minutes 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (an unblinking glass eye)

You force a target to see what should remain unseen.

- The target must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 17) or become paranoid, seeing shadowy figures lurking just beyond their vision.
- While paranoid, the target has disadvantage on Perception checks and must roll a d6 at the start of each turn:

The effect ends early if the target passes three consecutive Wisdom saves or if a greater restoration is cast.

| 1–3   | The hallucinations whisper terrible secrets, causing 2d8 cognitive damage.         |

#### Wogar's Harvest of Haunting Onyx
*7th-level Necromancy*
*Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: nan 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a juniper sprig)

You call forth shards of haunting onyx, manifested through the parasitic agony of something older than time. Choose up to **three creatures within range**. Each target must make a **Constitution saving throw**.

On a failed save, the creature:
- Takes **7d10 chiaric damage**, their essence siphoned and crystallized into flickering slivers of shadowy gemstone.
- Suffers **disadvantage on death saving throws** until the end of your next turn, as remnants of their soul splinter and drift.
- You **regain hit points equal to half** the total damage dealt across all targets.

On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and you gain no healing from them.

**At Higher Levels.**  
When cast using a **9th-level spell slot**:
- You may affect **up to 5 creatures** instead of 3.
- The healing gained is equal to **the full damage** dealt rather than half.

The Elders of the Concord Spire refuse to acknowledge The Spear of Forgotten Kings, calling it 'a mistake in the fabric of the world.' Yet, the forbidden archives tell another story.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher: Reality trembles slightly, causing a ripple that lingers unseen.

The rogue artificer Veyl Renshaw designed an enchanted device that could replicate Wogar's Harvest of Haunting Onyx. She activated it only once—her house was later found standing, but all its doors opened into an endless void.
> 
> To cast Wogar's Harvest of Haunting Onyx is to invite a presence that does not belong. The words taste of static, the gestures feel like echoes of hands not your own.*

#### Womb of the Unwritten
*5th-level Enchantment*
*Cleric, Wizard*

**Casting Time:** :: 10 minutes
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: Permanent (until the anomaly resolves itself) 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (a drop of void-infused ink, absorbed into the skin)

You whisper an incantation not meant for mortal tongues, invoking the presence of something that waits between fate and flesh. The spell rewrites the biological continuity of the target’s reproductive essence, severing it from natural law and entangling it with the unknown.
 
- Upon casting, the target must roll a d6—their fate is dictated by an unseen force:
 
- The change is not immediately noticed—it takes effect subtly, like a whisper embedded in the fabric of their being.
- Any attempt to reverse the effect without understanding it risks creating a secondary anomaly, potentially rewriting the target’s entire genetic structure.

| Roll  | Side Effect Description                                                                                                                                                                |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1–2   | Fertility Erasure – The target is forgotten by the lineage of time; they can no longer conceive, and records of their ancestry begin to fade from existence.                       |
| 3–4   | Unstable Genesis – The target’s fertility is unpredictably altered, capable of conception or sterility depending on external anomalies—moon phases, forgotten dreams, or whispers. |
| 5     | Fractured Inheritance – Any offspring conceived by the target will inherit memories, scars, or traits from an unknown progenitor, one that never lived yet has always existed.     |
| 6     | The Unborn Take Root – The target experiences a phantasmal pregnancy, feeling the weight of something growing within them—yet no child is ever born, only a presence that lingers. |

#### Yarol's Solitude
*7th-level Transmutation*
*Wizard, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Reaction
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Duration:** :: nan 
**Components:** :: Verbal 

As poison takes hold of a creature, you interject a fragment of forgotten transmutation—an ancient algorithm embedded in the bones of the world. The poison twists, sharpens, and magnifies into something far more insidious.

When a creature within range becomes **poisoned**, you may use your **reaction** to invoke Yarol’s Solitude. That creature must make a **Constitution saving throw**.

- **On a failure**, the poison **mutates into a paralytic toxin**. The creature becomes **paralyzed for 1d3 rounds**, instead of poisoned. Their body stiffens in place, overwhelmed by the sudden chemical transformation.
- **On a success**, the creature resists paralysis, but the altered poison still takes hold. They are **slowed for 1d3 rounds**, and **remain poisoned**. While slowed, they cannot take reactions and their movement speed is halved.

**Anomaly Effect:**
_When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher:_  
_An obsidian bloom briefly sprouts beneath the target. The next spell you cast on them (before the end of your next turn) has advantage to hit, or they have disadvantage on their saving throw._

Deep within the catacombs of Old Concord, the walls bear carvings of Yarol's Solitude. The inscriptions shift when unobserved, as if the stone itself is trying to remember something it once forgot.
> 
> Some scholars believe that Yarol's Solitude was not invented, but rather discovered—a piece of an equation written in the bones of the world itself.*

#### Yarol's Veil
*4th-level Illusion*
*Warlock, Sorcerer*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 minute
**Range:**        :: Self Sphere/30 ft
**Duration:** :: nan 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic, Material (nail clippings)

You wrap yourself in the forgotten script of Yarol, creating a mobile sphere of veiled perception. For the duration, all creatures of your choice within a 30-foot radius of you become invisible. The area of effect moves with you, but the spell ends early if you move faster than half your speed, cast a spell, or make an attack.

Objects not held or worn remain visible, even if within the veil. Items carried by invisible creatures vanish along with them. Light, sound, and scent still pass through the veil—this is not silence, only obfuscation.

Creatures under this effect become heavily obscured to others, but not to one another—those within can still see each other clearly, as if the veil exists only to conceal them from the outside world.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher: Reality trembles slightly, causing a ripple that lingers unseen.

The Veil Market traders whisper of an artifact that contains Yarol's Veil—a single black page that cannot be burned, torn, or marked. Those who read it vanish, leaving behind only the scent of ink and decay.

#### Zenith of Crimson Greed
*2nd-level Illusion*
*Wizard, Warlock*

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self Cube/15 ft
**Duration:** :: nan 
**Components:** :: Verbal, Somatic 

You touch the ground and whisper a name you barely remember. From your footsteps outward, false tracks begin to form—hoofprints, boot treads, claw marks, or even monstrous trails not known to local fauna. The chosen prints spread outward within a 15-foot cube, weaving seamlessly between your real path and the illusions.

These false tracks do not erase your actual trail, but instead obscure, redirect, or convolute it—causing anyone attempting to track you to suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to follow your true movements. A creature that examines the tracks closely can make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to discern the deception.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page
You may choose up to 2 distinct track types, layering them for added confusion. The illusion remains even through moderate weather or foot traffic but fades exactly 36 hours after casting.

**Anomaly Effect:**
When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher:
A golden shimmer flickers across the ground for a heartbeat. Somewhere nearby, an echo of your steps continues walking without you.

Deep within the catacombs of Old Concord, the walls bear carvings of Zenith of Crimson Greed. The inscriptions shift when unobserved, as if the stone itself is trying to remember something it once forgot.

### Blood Pacts: Binding Magic to the Caster’s Soul
A Blood Pact is an irrevocable magical contract, sealed with the caster’s own blood and identity, used to fuel powerful spells without external payment. Unlike Blood Seals, which are written sigils, Blood Pacts bind the magic directly to the summoner, making them deeply personal and dangerous.

#### Types of Blood Pacts
A Blood Pact can take different forms depending on the spell, some requiring additional sacrifices beyond the caster’s signature.

| Pact Name | Effects & Risks |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Oath of Blood *(Standard Pact)* | The caster writes their name in blood to bind the spell to them. |
| Vitality Sacrifice *(Life-Bound Pact)* | Costs Hit Points equal to the spell level. The damage cannot be healed magically until the next long rest and inflicts Minor Arcane Strain. |
| Offering of the Self *(Essence Pact)* | The caster sacrifices a memory, skill, or aspect of their identity to fuel the spell. *(Example: permanently losing proficiency in a skill, forgetting a person, or reducing a stat by 1 for 24 hours.)* |
| True Name Etching *(Replaces "True Name Pact")* | Requires a True Name Etching of the target. If the etching is destroyed, the spell breaks prematurely. |
| Unique Offering *(Custom Pact - Spell-Specific)* | Some spells require additional unique sacrifices, detailed in the spell description. *(Example: Summoning an entity might require "A year of servitude upon death.")* |
| Faded Beauty *(Ephemeral Pact)* | The caster’s beauty is siphoned, causing a -1 penalty to Charisma. This effect ends after a long rest. |
| Pleasure Numbing *(Sensory Pact)* | The caster’s senses become dulled, imposing a -1 penalty to Wisdom. This effect wears off after a few hours. |

#### Using a Blood Pact
- Multiple Blood Pacts stack, but excessive use fragments the caster’s identity.
- Spells using Blood Pacts bypass normal material costs but carry supernatural risks.
- If a caster maintains more than 3 active Blood Pacts, they must roll on the Blood Pact Fragmentation Table to determine how their connection to reality begins to degrade.

#### Blood Pact Fragmentation Table *(Roll 1d6)*
| Roll | Effect |
|---------|-----------|
| 1-2: Unstable | The caster’s sense of time and space fluctuates. They suffer disadvantage on all Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks for 24 hours. |
| 3-4: Altered | Reality shifts around the caster, warping their voice, reflection, or shadow in disturbing ways. They must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or become Frightened of their own reflection for 1 hour. |
| 5-6: Displaced | The caster is out of sync with reality. Once per short rest, there is a 10% chance their spell targets the wrong creature, object, or area as the magic shifts unpredictably. |

#### Destroying a Blood Pact Prematurely
- Severing a Blood Pact before its completion results in spell failure, memory corruption, or unpredictable magical backlash *(roll on the Blood Pact Fragmentation Table immediately).*
- A severed pact may leave lingering traces on the caster’s soul, body, or identity *(phantom pains, forgotten names, or unnatural compulsions)*.

#### Legal & Paranormal Risks
- Possession of a Blood Pact is illegal in most corporate jurisdictions.
- A.S.T.R.A.L. actively monitors known occultists, and those caught making pacts with unknown entities may face investigation, detainment, or erasure.
- The more Blood Pacts a person carries, the thinner their connection to reality becomes *(multiple pacts may cause side effects like whispers, hallucinations, or altered perception over time).*

> *"Paperwork can be shredded. Records can be erased. But a Blood Pact? That’s forever—until something takes its place."*
> — V. Ormont, Occult Archivist


#### Pleasure Numbing (Temporary Wisdom Drain)
- Certain seduction or indulgence-based spells reduce Wisdom temporarily, numbing pleasure and sensation.
- Wisdom loss stacks with repeated use and is restored by magical healing, restoration, or a long rest.
- If Wisdom reaches 0, the caster becomes emotionally catatonic, unable to experience joy, fear, or motivation for 1d4 days.

#### Beauty Sipping (Temporary Charisma Drain)
- Certain seduction and charm spells reduce Charisma temporarily as the caster’s allure is drained.
- Charisma loss stacks with repeated use and is restored by magical healing, restoration, or a long rest.
- If Charisma reaches 0, the caster enters a magically induced coma until they recover.

# Expanded Conditions
In addition to the standard conditions in 5e (such as Charmed, Restrained, and Incapacitated), Vestigium introduces new conditions reflecting bureaucratic enforcement, surveillance, reality distortions, and eldritch mutations.  

These conditions add unique roleplay opportunities, strategic interactions, and thematic horror elements of contractual magic, compliance, and anomalies.

---

### Under Contract
A creature is magically or bureaucratically bound to an agreement, contract, or supernatural force.  
- The creature cannot willingly violate the contract unless they succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC varies by effect).  
- If the contract is violated, the creature suffers a penalty, such as psychic damage, exhaustion, or forced compliance.  
- A creature attempting to escape the contract must provide legal justification, magical authority, or exploit a loophole, requiring a Charisma (Deception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check (DC 15).  
- This condition is similar to the Charmed condition, except that it compels specific actions rather than simply altering disposition.

---

### Under Surveillance
A creature is being actively monitored by an unseen force, such as corporate security, eldritch entities, or an automated oversight system.  
- The creature has disadvantage on Stealth checks, as they are being tracked.  
- Their location is known to the surveillance entity at all times.  
- If the creature attempts to break a monitored rule, they must make a Charisma saving throw (DC 15) or trigger a recorded infraction leading to future consequences.  
- If the creature becomes Erased or Unstable, they are removed from surveillance.  
- This condition does not restrict actions but makes evasion or secrecy more difficult.  

---

### Compelled
A creature has been subtly influenced into following a directive but believes it is acting of its own free will.  
- The creature rationalizes their compliance instead of resisting.  
- If given an order that contradicts their core beliefs, they may attempt a Wisdom saving throw (DC varies by effect).  
- If another creature openly questions their actions, the target makes a DC 15 Intelligence (Insight) check to recognize the manipulation.  
- If this condition persists for more than 24 hours, the creature’s personality begins to permanently shift to align with the imposed directive.  
- This condition is similar to Charmed, but it forces a specific behavioral change instead of improving social interactions.

---

### Delayed
A creature’s actions require external authorization to proceed.  
- When taking an action, the creature must roll a d20:  
  - 11 or higher – The action succeeds.  
  - 10 or lower – The action fails and cannot be attempted again until their next turn.  
- If a Watched creature fails this roll, their action is automatically denied by the surveillance entity.  
- If the creature attempts the same action multiple times, they must make a Charisma (Deception) check (DC 15) to justify the request.  
- A creature that is Erased is not registered in any system, meaning they ignore this condition.  
- This condition is similar to Restrained, except it affects actions instead of movement.

---

### Unstable
A creature’s existence is fluctuating, causing their actions to be unpredictable.  
- At the start of each turn, the creature rolls a d4:  
  - 1: They lose their turn, as if momentarily erased.  
  - 2-3: They act normally.  
  - 4: They act twice, as reality overcompensates for lost time.  
- If three or more creatures in the same area are Unstable, reality begins to glitch, creating environmental anomalies.  
- If the creature is observed closely (Perception DC 15), they appear flickering or slightly out of sync with the world.  
- This condition has similarities to Incapacitated, but instead of complete loss of actions, it introduces random instability.  


### Erased
A creature is slowly fading from reality—their presence is no longer acknowledged.  
- Initially, weak connections fade—their name is harder to recall, documents mentioning them become illegible.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

- The creature cannot be healed, as magic fails to register them as a valid target.  
- Any attempt to call for help, persuade, or socially interact automatically fails unless the listener succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence check.  
- If this condition lasts for 24 hours, the creature becomes incorporeal, existing as a memory rather than a physical entity.  
- The creature may attempt a DC 15 Wisdom save to anchor themselves back into reality if they see themselves in a mirror or hear their own name spoken.  
- This condition is similar to Invisible, but instead of being unseen, the creature is simply forgotten.  

---

### Altered
A creature’s thoughts, memories, and personality have been forcibly rewritten by external forces.  
- The creature forgets a key piece of information, chosen by the GM or spell effect.  
- The creature believes a falsehood as absolute truth and cannot be convinced otherwise.  
- If another creature challenges their memory, the affected creature must pass a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become hostile toward the challenger.  
- If this condition persists for more than 24 hours, the alteration becomes permanent, and the creature must undergo a major psychological event to undo it.

---

### Displaced
A creature exists in multiple places at once, but only one version is real.  
- At the start of their turn, they must choose a location within 30 feet—they are now standing there instead of their original position.  
- If attacked, they roll a d6:  
  - 1-3: The attack hits their real body.  
  - 4-6: The attack hits an afterimage, causing 1d6 psychic damage instead.  
- The creature cannot tell which version of themselves is real unless they succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence check.  

---

### Mutated
A creature’s body refuses to maintain a stable form, changing unpredictably.  
- Each time the creature takes damage, roll a d6:  
  - 1-2: They grow an extra limb, eye, or mouth that functions but feels unnatural.  
  - 3-4: They lose a minor body feature (e.g., fingernails, a nostril, or body hair).  
  - 5-6: Their body becomes semi-fluid, granting resistance to bludgeoning damage but making them vulnerable to slashing damage.  
- After three mutations, the creature must pass a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or the changes become permanent.  
- After five mutations, the creature ceases to be fully humanoid and must be cured through an anomaly reversal.  

### Paranoid
The creature becomes convinced it is being watched, judged, or hunted—whether true or not.

- The creature has disadvantage on Insight and Perception checks due to overwhelming suspicion.
- They cannot benefit from the Help action, and they treat all allies as if they had half cover.
- If the creature ends its turn alone, it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or use its movement to get closer to the nearest creature, friend or foe.

If this condition lasts for more than 1 hour, the creature begins to hallucinate phantom observers.

### Bleeding
The creature is suffering from a magical or paranormal wound that won’t close on its own.

- At the start of each of its turns, the creature takes 1d6 necrotic damage.
- If the creature is below half its hit point maximum, the damage increases to 2d6.
- Bleeding ends if the creature receives any healing or succeeds on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.

Creatures that die while Bleeding leave no corpse—only a red outline etched into the ground.

### Aroused
The creature’s nervous system is overstimulated, flooding it with conflicting signals of pleasure and confusion.

- The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom and Intelligence saving throws.
- The creature’s speed is halved.
- While Aroused, the creature cannot take reactions and has disadvantage on ability checks to maintain concentration.

If the creature is damaged while Aroused, they must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of their next turn.

### Mutated
A creature’s body refuses to maintain a stable form, changing unpredictably.

Each time the creature takes damage, roll a d6:
- 1–2: They grow an extra limb, eye, or mouth that functions but feels unnatural.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
\page

- 3–4: They lose a minor body feature (e.g., fingernails, a nostril, or body hair).
- 5–6: Their body becomes semi-fluid, gaining resistance to bludgeoning damage but vulnerability to slashing damage.

After 3 mutations, the creature must pass a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or the changes become permanent.  
After 5 mutations, the creature ceases to be fully humanoid and must be cured through an anomaly reversal or similar spell.

# Missed Attacks & Friendly Fire – Concord City Edition  

## 1. Missed Ranged Attacks (Weapons & Spells)  
If a ranged weapon attack or spell attack misses, check the difference between the attack roll and the target’s AC:  

- Missed by 1-5 → The attack continues in a straight line and hits the next creature in line (roll a new attack roll).  
- Missed by more than half the target’s AC → The attack is completely lost (no further rolls).  
- Missed by 6 or more (but not more than half AC) → An adjacent creature (within 5 feet of the original target) is hit instead (roll a new attack roll).  

If there is no other target in range, the attack hits an object, wall, or disappears.  

---

## 2. Blind Shots (Firing Without Sight)  
If attacking without seeing the target (due to blindness, darkness, invisibility, etc.):  

- If the attack misses, it travels 10 feet in a random direction.  
- If another creature is within that 10 feet, they are hit instead.  

---

## 3. Area of Effect Spells & Explosions (Missed Target Rule)  
For AoE spells and explosives (Fireball, Cone of Cold, grenades, etc.), if the attack misses the intended location:  

- The area of effect shifts 10 feet in a random direction.  
- Creatures in the new area must make the appropriate saving throws.  
- If no creatures are hit, the spell dissipates.  

\page

# Spell Convergence (Dual-Caster Flanking)
If two spellcasters target the same creature with spells on the same party turn, they may choose one of the following effects:  

### Spell Convergence Effects (Choose One)
- Arcane Overload – The target has disadvantage on its next saving throw against one of the spells cast this turn.  
- Weaving Energies – If both spells require attack rolls, each caster gains a +1 bonus to their spell attack roll.  
- Disruptive Resonance – If both spells deal the same type of damage, the target suffers -2 AC until the start of the next party turn.  
- Entropy Cascade – If both spells have a duration longer than 1 round, the duration extends by 1 additional round (to a max of double duration).  
- Echoing Spells – If both spells have the same saving throw type, the target must roll the saving throw twice and take the lower result (this does not stack with disadvantage).  

### Conditions for Spell Convergence
- Two different spellcasters must target the same creature with spells (area-of-effect spells count if the creature is inside the area).  
- Spells must be cast within the same party turn (this works naturally within the Party Initiative system).  
- Only one Spell Convergence effect applies per pair of casters.  
- Casters do not need to cast the same spell or even the same spell level—just targeting the same enemy is enough.  
- A third spellcaster does not stack additional effects, but they can contribute to another separate Spell Convergence.  

---

## Ritual Instability (DM-Optional Rule)
At the DM's discretion, if two spellcasters attempt to cast the same spell at the same time, unpredictable effects may occur:  
- The spell overloads and mutates, producing unexpected paranormal results.  
- The spells cancel each other out as magical forces collapse into nothingness.  
- The spells merge into a single, more powerful effect, amplifying its magnitude.  
- A paranormal anomaly forms, creating lingering magical disturbances in the area.  

The DM chooses whether Ritual Instability takes effect based on the situation.
