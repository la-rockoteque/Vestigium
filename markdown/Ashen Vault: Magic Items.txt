## Preface to the Treatise on Wondrous Relics
### By Scholar Aldric Vaelthorne, University of Lysoria
It is with great reverence and no small measure of trepidation that I commit my studies to parchment. For centuries, the University of Lysoria has stood as a beacon of knowledge, a refuge for scholars seeking to unearth the arcane mysteries woven into the fabric of our world. My own research, though but a fragment of this grand tradition, is dedicated to one of the most elusive and enigmatic subjects: Wondrous Artifacts—objects imbued with power beyond mortal reckoning, whose origins, nature, and consequences defy simple explanation.

From the whispered legends of Aelvarian relics to the sealed vaults of the Dread Conclave, history is littered with accounts of items that shape destiny—artifacts that sing with forgotten voices, consume the ambitions of their wielders, or bind the very laws of reality to their whims. I have sought these artifacts in crumbling archives, lost ruins, and the dark corners of whispered lore, attempting to catalog their nature, decipher their mechanisms, and unveil their true purpose. Yet, for every truth uncovered, two new riddles emerge.

This treatise is not merely an academic exercise; it is a warning. The wise recognize that knowledge of wondrous artifacts is a double-edged blade—to study them is to risk temptation, obsession, and calamity. Even those crafted with benevolence can, in time, become harbingers of ruin.

Thus, I present these findings to those who, like myself, seek wisdom rather than dominion. May the discerning mind navigate these pages with both curiosity and caution, lest they, too, become a footnote in the long history of ambition undone by wonder.

# Preface to the Grand Compendium of Wondrous Artifacts

## By Scholar Aldric Vaelthorne,
## Senior Archivist of the University of Lysoria
}}

There exists a peculiar quality to objects touched by magic—a lingering presence, an imprint of their makers, their wielders, and the unseen forces that have shaped them. Some scholars debate whether such artifacts are merely vessels of power, while others insist that they possess a will of their own, guiding history as much as they are shaped by it. My years of study have led me to conclude that the truth, as ever, is far more elusive.

This compendium is not a catalog of relics alone, nor is it merely an inventory of enchantments. It is a chronicle of consequence, an exploration of how objects can outlive their creators, accumulating histories, burdens, and purposes beyond what was ever intended. A blade tempered in the fires of conquest may, centuries later, refuse to be drawn except by a rightful heir long forgotten. A lantern that once guided lost souls to safety may, under the weight of neglect, grow bitter, twisting its purpose into a beacon for calamity instead.

The study of such artifacts is not one of idle curiosity. Those who seek them often do so not for knowledge, but for power—be it the power to reshape fate, to defy the natural order, or to undo that which should remain untouched. History is littered with names of those who sought control over the wondrous, only to find themselves enslaved by it instead.

As such, I extend a warning to any who turn these pages:
To know of these objects is to be known by them. Some are waiting, some are watching, and some—gods forbid—are listening.

Proceed accordingly.


### *The Shard of Unwritten Truths*
*Edible, Very Rare*
A **small, crystalline fragment**, humming softly when touched.
Swallowing it **reveals a hidden truth about the world**, chosen randomly from the infinite knowledge of forgotten ages.
The truth **cannot be unknown once consumed**, and it may be:
- A **personal secret** about the drinker’s own past they had forgotten.
- A **cosmic revelation** about the structure of reality.
- A **divine mystery** that was not meant to be learned.
However, if the user **cannot comprehend what they have learned**, they must succeed on a **DC 20 Wisdom saving throw** or suffer **permanent, haunting visions**.

---

### *The Elixir of Many Faces*
*Potion, Very Rare*
A **liquid mirror**, reflecting countless shifting faces.
Drinking it allows the user to **fully transform into another humanoid** of their choice for **1 hour**—not just in appearance, but in **memories, voice, and mannerisms**.
At the end of the hour, they must **make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw** or **forget who they originally were** for the next 24 hours, leaving them trapped in their borrowed identity.

---

### *The Tear of the Exiled God*
*Potion, Legendary*
A **golden droplet**, shimmering with latent divinity.
Drinking it grants the user **a fraction of an ancient god’s power**, allowing them to:
- **Radiate celestial light**, burning undead and fiends within **30 feet**.
- **Speak with absolute authority**, giving them **advantage on all Persuasion checks**.
- **Perform a miracle**, curing one **disease, curse, or affliction** instantly.
However, the exiled god **knows who has consumed its tear**, and it **will come looking** to reclaim what is rightfully its own.

---

### *The Writ of Cosmic Exchange*
*Edible, Legendary*
A **thin parchment**, written in ink that **bleeds and shifts** as if alive.
Eating it **erases one aspect of the user’s existence**—a name, a memory, a physical trait—in exchange for something of **equal metaphysical weight**.
The exchange is **final** and cannot be undone.
A user may choose to:
- **Give up their voice** to gain **perfect telepathic communication**.
- **Sacrifice their sight** in exchange for **prophetic visions of the future**.
- **Forget their own name**, making them **immune to all tracking and divination**.
Once consumed, the **universe corrects itself**, and **no one remembers what was lost**.

### *The Moon’s Last Reflection*
*Potion, Very Rare*
A **pale silver liquid**, shimmering under moonlight but dull in sunlight.
Drinking it allows the user to **experience the dreams of the moon itself**, gaining insight into the **ancient past and future of the world**.
However, the moon’s dreams are **not meant for mortals**—after waking, the user must succeed on a **DC 18 Wisdom saving throw** or experience **sleepwalking
\page
episodes for 1d6 days**, during which they unconsciously **whisper secrets of the cosmos**.

### *The Ink of Living Flesh*
*Potion, Rare*
A **thick, pulsating black ink**, warm as blood.
Drinking it **allows the user to write a single sentence on their skin**, and that statement **becomes true** for 24 hours.
However, the ink **demands a price**—each time it is used, it leaves behind **a living scar**, shifting and whispering with **fragments of an unknown consciousness**.

---

### *The Coffin-Binder’s Draught*
*Potion, Very Rare*
A **sepia-hued liquid**, thick like grave soil.
Drinking it allows the user to **return from death once**—if they die within the next **24 hours**, they automatically stabilize and rise with **half their hit points**.
However, they return **marked by the grave**, becoming permanently colder to the touch, and undead creatures **recognize them as kin**.


### *The Hunger of the Dying Star*
*Potion, Legendary*
A **black, swirling vortex**, trapped in a glass vial.
Drinking it **grants the user immense power**, doubling all their **attack damage, magical potency, and physical abilities** for **one minute**.
However, once the effect ends, they must succeed on a **DC 19 Constitution saving throw** or suffer **complete bodily collapse**, as their cells burn out like a dying sun.

---

### *The Candle of the Forgotten Soul*
*Consumable, Rare*
A **small wax candle**, its flame **burning a deep blue**.
Lighting it allows the user to **speak with a long-dead soul**, calling their spirit forth from the veil of oblivion for **five minutes**.
However, the candle’s flame does **not go out on its own**—once lit, the summoned spirit **chooses when it is finished speaking**.

---

### *The Liquor of Unmaking*
*Potion, Very Rare*
A **violet-black fluid**, shifting between states of matter.
Drinking it **temporarily severs the user from reality**, making them intangible and immune to all damage for **10 minutes**.
However, the longer they remain unmade, the harder it is to return—if they stay in this state for the full duration, they must succeed on a **DC 18 Intelligence saving throw** or risk **becoming a forgotten anomaly, lost between worlds**.

---

### *The Breath of the Vanished Gods*
*Potion, Mythic*
A **bottle of thick, blue mist**, shifting like the dawn sky.
Drinking it **momentarily turns the user into an ethereal being**, letting them drift through walls, across dimensions, and into the **hidden spaces between reality** for **one minute**.
However, ancient, forgotten gods **may take notice**, whispering their forgotten names into the drinker’s soul.


### *Unbranded Keycard*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*
A plain plastic keycard with a faded magnetic stripe. When inserted into an electronic lock, it rewrites the access protocol, allowing the user to bypass security as if they had proper clearance. Each use corrupts the stripe further—after three uses, the keycard demagnetizes and becomes inert.

### *A.S.T.R.A.L. Incident Report (Form X-17B)*
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*
A manila folder stamped **“CONFIDENTIAL”**. Filling out the report with an entity’s name and incident details causes reality to alter slightly, classifying the target as an *“anomalous

occurrence”* in all official records. As long as the report remains in the folder, the target is ignored by automated systems, security patrols, and corporate bureaucracies.

### *The Static Memo*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*
A corporate memorandum typed on thin paper, permanently dated decades ago. When read aloud, it fills the air with crackling static. The user can rewrite the memo’s contents once per long rest, overwriting a minor detail of reality within a small radius. Objects might change places, conversations might be rewritten, and security footage may depict a different version of events.

### *Punch Clock of Endless Shifts*
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*
A battered time clock, still attached to a fragment of a concrete wall. When used to “clock in,” the user enters a temporary pocket of stagnation where time moves differently. The next hour passes in mere seconds for the user, allowing them to perform mundane tasks (such as repairing equipment or analyzing documents) at unnatural speed.
However, using the clock more than once per day causes time desynchronization—roll 1d20; on a 1, the user loses 1d4 hours without memory of the passage of time.

### *Redacted Badge*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*
A security ID with all details permanently blacked out. When worn, it grants the user the ability to walk into any secured area as though they belong there. This effect lasts for up to 10 minutes or until someone directly questions the user’s presence, at which point the badge becomes useless for the remainder of the day.

\page
### *Telepathic Tape Recorder*
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*
A bulky cassette recorder with an input jack but no microphone. It records thoughts instead of sound, transcribing them onto magnetic tape. The user can rewind and play back a recording, allowing them to replay up to 10 minutes of recent thought activity. Extracted thoughts fade after 24 hours, becoming garbled whispers.

### *The Eversigning Contract*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*
An old corporate contract that automatically adjusts its terms to fit any legal agreement. If a creature signs its name, the contract magically binds them to its terms, which can be rewritten by the last legal expert who held the document.
Destroying the contract is difficult—it reappears in another filing cabinet or office within 1d4 days.

### *The Unopened Envelope*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*
A sealed, yellowed envelope with no return address. When given to someone, they instinctively understand that it contains bad news—termination notices, blackmail, or legal action. If the recipient refuses to open it, they suffer increasing paranoia, gaining disadvantage on Insight and Perception checks.
If opened, the envelope vanishes, taking with it one minor piece of the recipient’s personal history (such as a forgotten conversation or misplaced item).

### *Ghostwrite Ink*
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*
A glass inkwell containing shifting, silvery ink. Anything written with this ink will appear in an official record somewhere in the city, altering logs, ledgers, and minutes of meetings. The change lasts for 24 hours before correcting itself, leaving only faint discrepancies behind.

### *Neon Halo*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*
A flickering neon sign shaped like a ring, detached from its original mounting. When placed on a surface, it floats slightly and emits a soft glow.
When worn above the head, it projects an aura of influence, making the user appear more important than they are. Creatures of equal or lower status instinctively defer to the wearer, treating them as if they belong in high-ranking circles.
However, prolonged use causes electrical disturbances and flickering lights within a 30-foot radius.

### *The Erroneous Document*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*
A heavily redacted legal document with no clear origin. When 

studied, the reader experiences a moment of cognitive dissonance. As an action, the user may declare **one fact** within 30 feet to be "erroneous," causing all creatures to subconsciously reject it. Doors may no longer exist, names may be unremembered, or weapons may feel unreal. The effect lasts for 1 minute, after which reality self-corrects.

### *The Faceless Identification Card*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*
A security badge that bears a shifting silhouette where a photograph should be. When displayed, the wearer appears unremarkable, as if they belong wherever they are.
For the next 10 minutes, all creatures suffer **disadvantage on checks to recall or describe the user** unless they directly interacted with them in a significant way.

### *The Whispering Ledger*
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*
An old financial ledger filled with numbers that never settle. When placed in a room, it begins murmuring in a low, rhythmic voice, echoing past conversations that were spoken in the space.
Once per long rest, the user can **ask the ledger a question** related to past events in its vicinity. It answers in fragmented whispers, revealing glimpses of lost knowledge, overheard secrets, or conversations that never truly happened.

### *Form 77B-Theta: Request for Removal*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*
A bureaucratic form requesting the erasure of an anomaly. If a creature’s full name is written on the form and submitted into a file cabinet, the target becomes **"pending removal"** for 24 hours.
During this time, security systems, surveillance, and bureaucratic records will **no longer register their existence**. The creature can still interact with the world, but official documents will treat them as an **unperson**, unable to buy, sell, or prove they exist. After 24 hours, reality reasserts itself, and all records return as normal.

### *The Paperclip of Undoing*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*
An ordinary office paperclip, twisted into an impossible shape. When used to fasten documents, it **erases one recorded event** from history within the last 24 hours, provided it was officially documented (in reports, footage, or ledgers).
The event is not undone—rather, it **ceases to have ever been recorded**, as though no one thought it significant at the time.

### *The Overdue Notice*
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*
A yellowed library slip dated long before the city’s founding. When slipped into a book, folder, or electronic file, it **alters the document’s contents** in subtle but unsettling ways—changing dates, modifying passages, or replacing key words with
\page
eldritch symbols.
For the next 24 hours, creatures who read the altered document must **succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence save or experience déjà vu**, believing they’ve seen the changes before and dismissing any inconsistencies.

### *The Forbidden Rubber Stamp*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*
A corporate-approved stamp labeled **"CLASSIFIED – EYES ONLY"**. When pressed onto paper, it **seals** all information within the document, rendering it unreadable to all but the user.
If another creature attempts to read it, their vision **blurs into static**, and they take 2d6 psychic damage per paragraph. Once the user shares the information aloud, it is permanently unlocked.

### *The Hollow Envelope*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*
An envelope with no weight, as if it holds nothing. When opened, it **contains a letter written in the reader’s own handwriting**, detailing events from **a timeline that never happened**.
The reader must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or suffer **fragments of false memories**, gaining a new piece of personal history that was never real. The memories feel authentic but contradict existing knowledge, causing long-term doubts and paranoia.

### *The Department of Redundancy Department Seal*
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*
A wax seal stamped with the words **"Approved for Approval"**. When affixed to an object or document, it **duplicates itself** into existence.
Using this seal on a weapon,

for example, creates a **slightly worse duplicate** (1d4 psychic damage to the wielder when attacking). Using it on legal documents creates **contradictory records**, confusing bureaucracies for 48 hours before they correct themselves.

### *The Anomaly-Laced Tape Reel*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*
A reel of magnetic tape that **records voices that were never spoken**. When played, it overlays reality with an **alternative conversation**, making the listener believe events unfolded differently.
The user may rewrite **up to 5 minutes of past conversation**, causing creatures present to remember the new version as real. This effect persists unless challenged with solid evidence.


### *The Veiled Mirror*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*
A tarnished, handheld mirror that reflects **only what should not be seen**. When gazed into, the reflection reveals **hidden entities**, **invisible objects**, or **distortions in reality**.
Once per long rest, the user may ask the mirror a **single question**, and it will show a **possible future**—though the image is cryptic, shifting, and unreliable.

### *The Hollow Crown*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Cursed)*
A crown made of **blackened bone**, adorned with shifting symbols. When worn, the bearer gains the ability to **command lesser creatures** within 60 feet (DC 17 Wisdom save). However, the wearer **slowly forgets their own identity**, as fragments of past rulers flood their mind.
Removing the crown requires a DC 20 Charisma saving throw; failure causes the user to **believe they have always been the ruler of an unknown kingdom**.

### *The Lantern of Liminal Light*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*
An old oil lantern that casts **no natural illumination**. Instead, its flickering glow reveals **places that do not belong**—hallways that lead somewhere else, staircases that should not exist, doors that were never built.
Once per long rest, the bearer may **step into a liminal space**, vanishing into a **threshold dimension** for up to 10 minutes.

### *The Maw of the Forgotten*
*Wondrous Item, Legendary*
A fleshy, pulsating mask with **too many teeth**. When worn, it grants **perfect recall**, allowing the user to remember any event with absolute clarity. However, it also **devours forgotten things**, erasing names, places, and people from reality.
Each time the mask is worn, roll 1d100. On a result of 10 or lower, a **random historical event is rewritten**, but no one notices except the wearer.

### *The Tear in the Page*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*
A fragment of paper with a **jagged hole** in its center. The hole is not torn but **missing**, as if something erased it from existence. Anything small enough to fit into the hole **ceases to exist**, though its absence is felt.
If placed over writing, the missing words can never be recalled, even by magical means.

### *The Stillheart Pendant*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*
A black stone locket that **does not open**. When worn, the bearer’s heartbeat **slows to a near stop**, granting immunity to being **detected by heartbeat, scrying, or supernatural senses**. However, if the wearer dies while wearing the pendant, their body **never decays**—it remains in a state of frozen stillness, unclaimed by time.

### *The Whispers Between Worlds*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*
A small, obsidian cube that, when held, **murmurs softly** in an unknown language. If the user listens for 1 minute, they gain a **random piece of knowledge** from an unknown source. This knowledge is true but always **dangerous to know**.
Once per week, the cube **forces a revelation** upon its owner, dealing 3d10
\page
psychic damage as the weight of unseen things presses upon their mind.

### *The Unraveling Thread*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*
A single strand of red thread that extends **infinitely** when pulled. When tied around an object or creature, it **separates them from causality**—for 1 minute, they cannot affect or be affected by anything, existing **outside the timeline**.
However, if the thread is severed, the tied object is **erased from the current moment**, skipping ahead as if it had never been present.

### *The Door That Breathes*
*Wondrous Item, Legendary*
A wooden doorframe with no wall to hold it, yet it **leads somewhere else** each time it is stepped through. The air around it **rises and falls**, like lungs inhaling unseen.
Once per long rest, the user may **choose** a door within 1 mile—the Door That Breathes will lead there, but it may **not lead back**.

### *The Shard of Unmaking*
*Wondrous Item, Artifact*
A sliver of **black glass**, colder than the void itself. When pressed against an object, it **erases its existence**, leaving behind **only an absence**—not destroyed, not broken, simply *unmade*.
Once per long rest, the shard may be used to **erase a single sentence from a creature’s memory**, rewriting their personal history as if that thought had never been formed.

## Vestigium Magic Items – Eldritch Anomalies II

### *The Unfinished Mask*
*Wondrous Item, Rare (Cursed)*
A porcelain mask with **half a face**, its features eerily smooth. When worn, the wearer **appears identical to another person** within 60 feet, mimicking their voice and gestures. However, their own reflection in mirrors **does not change**.
If the mask is worn for more than an hour, the user must succeed on a **DC 17 Charisma saving throw** or permanently **lose their own face**, becoming a blank humanoid figure unable to be recognized by anyone they once knew.

### *The Eclipsed Hourglass*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*
An hourglass filled with **dark sand**, which does not fall but **rises** in defiance of gravity. Turning the hourglass **pauses time for one minute** for everything except the user. However, after the sand finishes rising, it does not reset—**each use is permanent**.
When all the sand has risen, the user vanishes **between time**, never to be found.

### *The Forgotten Door*
*Wondrous Item, Legendary*
A rusted doorknob unattached to anything. When turned, it **creates a door** on any surface, leading to **a room that should not exist**—a forgotten space between worlds.
The room is empty, save for **a single object left behind by an unknown hand**. Each time the door is opened, the object is different.

### *The Eye That Wanders*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*
A small, glass eyeball that **blinks** occasionally, despite having no eyelids. The user may place the eye anywhere, after which they can **see through it** at will, no matter the distance. However, **each night at midnight**, the eye moves somewhere else, appearing in an unknown place.
If the user ever sees their **own sleeping form** through the eye, they must make a **DC 18 Wisdom saving throw** or be paralyzed with existential dread for 1 hour.

### *The Mnemonic Shard*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*
A smooth, obsidian fragment **engraved with shifting names**. When pressed against a person’s forehead, it **extracts a single memory**, placing it inside the shard. The memory becomes fully **erased** from the subject’s mind.
The shard holds **three memories** at a time. If a fourth is stored, the oldest one **escapes**, returning to its owner in a sudden, overwhelming flood of lost experience.

### *The Silent Bell*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*
A small brass bell that **does not ring** when shaken. When activated, it silences an area **within 30 feet for one minute**—not just sound, but **all presence**. Creatures within the area cannot be noticed, recorded, or perceived by any means.

### *The Severed Thread*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*
A single strand of **golden thread**, frayed at both ends. When tied around an object or person, it **severs them from fate**—they become immune to divination, cannot be targeted by prophecy, and exist **outside destiny’s path**.
However, if the thread is ever cut, **the person was never meant to exist at all**—all memories of them are lost, and their presence vanishes from history.

### *The Mirror That Breathes*
*Wondrous Item, Legendary*
A tall, silver mirror that fogs **as if something is breathing behind the glass**. When stepped into, it acts as **a gateway**, leading to an **identical yet subtly wrong** version of the world. Everything is **slightly off**—words rearrange themselves, familiar people act strangely, and colors don’t quite match.
The user may **walk freely between realities** for up to 10 
\page
minutes, but after that, they must **roll 1d100**. On a result of **10 or lower**, the mirror **refuses to let them leave**.

### *The Unfinished Letter*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*
A half-written letter that **always addresses the reader by name**, no matter who looks at it. The content describes **something they have not yet done**, as if predicting the future.
Each night, **one more sentence appears**, pushing the reader toward an inevitable outcome. The last sentence is always **a warning**.

### *The Key to Nowhere*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*
A rusted key that **fits no known lock**. When turned in midair, it **creates a door**, leading to **a place outside space**—a featureless void where time does not pass.

### *The Beckoning Shadow*
*Wondrous Item, Legendary (Cursed)*
A shadow that **does not belong** to its owner. It moves **slightly out of sync**, flickers unnaturally, and sometimes appears to **look back** at them.
Once per day, the user may **step into their shadow**, vanishing into complete darkness for up to 1 minute. While inside, they are **untouchable**—but each use gives the shadow **more autonomy**.
If used more than three times, the shadow **does not return** when they step out, continuing to move on its own.

### *The Maw Beneath the Floorboards*
*Wondrous Item, Artifact*
A **gap** in the world that should not be. It can be placed **on any flat surface**, and when activated, the surface **opens** into a black void filled with **teeth and whispers**.

However, each time it is fed, **the Maw grows larger**.

### *The Last Door*
*Wondrous Item, Artifact*
A **black wooden door**, freestanding in an empty frame. It does not open.
Each time the user **asks the door a question**, they hear a voice whisper from the other side. The door knows **everything**, but it **never tells the truth directly**—it twists words, gives riddles, and offers **half-truths** that always lead to unintended consequences.
One day, the door **will open on its own**. The user will not be able to stop it.

### *The Book That Reads You*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*
A leather-bound tome with **no title and no known author**. When opened, its pages begin filling with text, describing **the reader’s thoughts, memories, and fears** in real-time.

A smooth, black stone that feels **warm to the touch**. When held, it **saps the user’s hunger and thirst**, allowing them to survive without food or drink.

### *The Doorframe to Nowhere*
*Wondrous Item, Legendary*
A lone **wooden frame** that stands without a wall. When walked through, the user arrives in **a different version of their world**—a place where one thing has **changed irreversibly**.

A stringless violin carved from **pale bone**. When drawn across the air, it plays **a sound only the dead can hear**.

Others come to **remember what it was like to be alive.**

### *The Bone of a Forgotten God*

A **massive, hollow bone**, too large to be from any known creature. When held, it hums faintly with **a heartbeat that is not your own**.

A thin, red thread, warm like **living skin**. When tied between two people, it **binds their sensations together**—what one feels, the other does as well.
