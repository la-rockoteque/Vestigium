*8th-level transmutation*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, M (key words whispered to a wooden token depicting a little mouse)
**Duration:**     :: 1 round
**School:**       :: Divination

Describe key words about a topic. This spell creates 2d4+1 swallows made of force energy that run from your hand towards written materials, such as books or scrolls.

When a swallow of force hits a written material containing one or more key words, the swallow is absorbed by the item, which starts floating towards the caster until it carefully drop on a surface.

The spell can locate a specific book or scroll or written material known to you, as long as you have clear recollection of its name or the author's or even its contents. And only if the said item is really present at the place, since the spell cannot create the item out of thin air, only locate it within range.

Similar to Locate Objects spell, this spell can't locate an object if any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocks a direct path between you and the object.
