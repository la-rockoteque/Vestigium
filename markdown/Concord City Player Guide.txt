## **Introduction to the Setting**

### **The Vestigium World – Concord City and the Floating Islands**
Concord City exists in a world shaped by a cataclysmic past. The **Vestigium World** is all that remains of the once-mighty world-trees, now reduced to floating crystal islands drifting in the void. These islands hold the remnants of civilization, each a different fragment of what was once a great world. Concord City was designed as a **planned settlement**—an attempt to create order amid the chaos following the collapse of the old world. Its architecture and infrastructure reflect that intent, built not for beauty but for function, with rigid zoning and tiered districts to separate the corporate elite from the struggling masses. The city's economy is driven by finance, trade, and research into the anomalies left behind from the old world’s destruction.

### **What is Concord City?**
Concord City is a sprawling **brutalist metropolis**, an economic and political hub controlled by **corporate entities, bureaucratic inertia, and decayed affluence**. It is a city of contradictions—highly regulated yet filled with lawless underground factions, technologically stagnant yet infused with paranormal anomalies. The streets are lined with old concrete buildings, flickering neon signs, and propaganda billboards reinforcing corporate dominance. While the city is in visible decay, its corporate masters maintain the illusion of control, ensuring that life continues under a rigid, bureaucratic structure. Here, survival is dictated by who you work for, who you owe, and what secrets you can leverage.

### **Aesthetics and Themes**
Concord City embodies **1970s corporate stagnation, brutalist architecture, and a low-tech, high-surveillance dystopia**. Unlike traditional cyberpunk, which features sleek neon streets and advanced technology, Concord City is weighed down by **analog technology, outdated mainframes, and a bureaucratic machine that refuses to evolve**. The paranormal is omnipresent but mundane, its influence hidden within everyday life—anomalous distortions ignored or quietly managed by the system. Corporate propaganda saturates the city, reinforcing themes of control, compliance, and the illusion of stability, while underground movements struggle to expose the truth.

### **What is The Emergence?**
The **Emergence** was a defining moment in Concord City's history—a massive, unexplained event in which thousands of humans appeared in the city overnight. Their sudden presence threw the city into chaos, igniting riots, societal upheaval, and mass paranoia. At the same time, three **colossal faces** manifested in the sky, unleashing destruction before vanishing just as mysteriously. This event triggered a wave of **paranormal anomalies**, some of which continue to shape the city's reality today. Though time has passed, the origins of The Emergence remain unknown, and the city's elite continue to suppress discussions about its true nature. Meanwhile, certain individuals have developed unexplained abilities, further complicating the balance of power.

### **What is A.S.T.R.A.L.?**
A.S.T.R.A.L. (**Agence de Surveillance et de Traitement des Réalités et des Anomalies Localisées**) is the shadowy government agency tasked with **investigating, containing, and managing paranormal phenomena** in Concord City. While the public acknowledges A.S.T.R.A.L.’s existence, its true scope and authority remain obscured. Officially, it is just an investigative body, but in reality, A.S.T.R.A.L. wields near-unlimited power when dealing with anomalies. They enforce strict regulations on the use of paranormal abilities, contain dangerous manifestations, and erase knowledge that threatens corporate stability. Whispers in the underground suggest that A.S.T.R.A.L. is hiding the truth about The Emergence, guarding secrets that could upend the fragile status quo.

### **Who Will You Be?**
This is a world where **truth is dangerous**, where the divide between reality and the unknown is thinner than it seems.  

- A **corporate enforcer** clawing your way to the top?  
- A **paranormal investigator** seeking to unravel the mysteries left behind by The Emergence?  
- A **rogue operator** in the black market, dealing in forbidden knowledge?  
- Or something else entirely?  

Concord City is waiting.  

**But the past never stays buried.**

Drinking it **temporarily severs the user from reality**, making them intangible and immune to all damage for **10 minutes**.  
However, the longer they remain unmade, the harder it is to return—if they stay in this state for the full duration, they must succeed on a **DC 18 Intelligence saving throw** or risk **becoming a forgotten anomaly, lost between worlds**.

---

### *The Breath of the Vanished Gods*  
*Potion, Mythic*  
A **bottle of thick, blue mist**, shifting like the dawn sky.  
Drinking it **momentarily turns the user into an ethereal being**, letting them drift through walls, across dimensions, and into the **hidden spaces between reality** for **one minute**.  
However, ancient, forgotten gods **may take notice**, whispering their forgotten names into the drinker’s soul.

---

These **consumables blend multiple themes—time manipulation, eldritch knowledge, transformation, divine/infernal power, madness, lost civilizations, and undeath**—into a **cohesive and unsettling set of items**.  

Would you like a **further refinement of this concept** or a **new direction entirely?**# Magic Items of Concord City  

### *The Artifacts That Should Not Exist*  

In Concord City, **magic is not a gift—it is an anomaly.**  

The artifacts and relics hidden beneath the corporate towers, lost within the Syndicate’s smuggling routes, or **classified deep within A.S.T.R.A.L.'s vaults** are not mere trinkets of power. They are **errors**—unaccounted-for remnants of **The Emergence**, corporate prototypes that should have never been built, or paranormal objects that continue to defy reason.  

Magic items in this world do not glow with mystical energy, nor do they whisper their names to worthy wielders. They **blend into the mundane**, lurking in the form of a **briefcase filled with self-writing contracts, a revolver that never misses, or a vial of liquid that rewrites memories as if editing a film reel**.  

Every artifact has a **history**, every object has a **classified report**, and most importantly—every item has a **cost.** Some can be stolen, some can be bought, and some will **find their way into the hands of those who were never meant to wield them.**  

Whether you are an A.S.T.R.A.L. officer retrieving an anomaly, a corporate enforcer testing experimental weapons, or an undercity smuggler selling relics from a forgotten age, **power comes with consequences.** These are not just tools—they are **problems** waiting to be solved, secrets waiting to be uncovered, and **mistakes waiting to be made again.**

## Vestigium Magic Items – Batch 1

### *Unbranded Keycard*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
A plain plastic keycard with a faded magnetic stripe. When inserted into an electronic lock, it rewrites the access protocol, allowing the user to bypass security as if they had proper clearance. Each use corrupts the stripe further—after three uses, the keycard demagnetizes and becomes inert.

### *A.S.T.R.A.L. Incident Report (Form X-17B)*
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*  
A manila folder stamped **“CONFIDENTIAL”**. Filling out the report with an entity’s name and incident details causes reality to alter slightly, classifying the target as an *“anomalous occurrence”* in all official records. As long as the report remains in the folder, the target is ignored by automated systems, security patrols, and corporate bureaucracies.

### *The Static Memo*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*  
A corporate memorandum typed on thin paper, permanently dated decades ago. When read aloud, it fills the air with crackling static. The user can rewrite the memo’s contents once per long rest, overwriting a minor detail of reality within a small radius. Objects might change places, conversations might be rewritten, and security footage may depict a different version of events.

### *Punch Clock of Endless Shifts*
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*  
A battered time clock, still attached to a fragment of a concrete wall. When used to “clock in,” the user enters a temporary pocket of stagnation where time moves differently. The next hour passes in mere seconds for the user, allowing them to perform mundane tasks (such as repairing equipment or analyzing documents) at unnatural speed.  
However, using the clock more than once per day causes time desynchronization—roll 1d20; on a 1, the user loses 1d4 hours without memory of the passage of time.

### *Redacted Badge*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
A security ID with all details permanently blacked out. When worn, it grants the user the ability to walk into any secured area as though they belong there. This effect lasts for up to 10 minutes or until someone directly questions the user’s presence, at which point the badge becomes useless for the remainder of the day.

### *Telepathic Tape Recorder*
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*  
A bulky cassette recorder with an input jack but no microphone. It records thoughts instead of sound, transcribing them onto magnetic tape. The user can rewind and play back a recording, allowing them to replay up to 10 minutes of recent thought activity. Extracted thoughts fade after 24 hours, becoming garbled whispers.

### *The Eversigning Contract*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*  
An old corporate contract that automatically adjusts its terms to fit any legal agreement. If a creature signs its name, the contract magically binds them to its terms, which can be rewritten by the last legal expert who held the document.  
Destroying the contract is difficult—it reappears in another filing cabinet or office within 1d4 days.

### *The Unopened Envelope*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
A sealed, yellowed envelope with no return address. When given to someone, they instinctively understand that it contains bad news—termination notices, blackmail, or legal action. If the recipient refuses to open it, they suffer increasing paranoia, gaining disadvantage on Insight and Perception checks.  
If opened, the envelope vanishes, taking with it one minor piece of the recipient’s personal history (such as a forgotten conversation or misplaced item).

### *Ghostwrite Ink*
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*  
A glass inkwell containing shifting, silvery ink. Anything written with this ink will appear in an official record somewhere in the city, altering logs, ledgers, and minutes of meetings. The change lasts for 24 hours before correcting itself, leaving only faint discrepancies behind.

### *Neon Halo*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*  
A flickering neon sign shaped like a ring, detached from its original mounting. When placed on a surface, it floats slightly and emits a soft glow.  
When worn above the head, it projects an aura of influence, making the user appear more important than they are. Creatures of equal or lower status instinctively defer to the wearer, treating them as if they belong in high-ranking circles.  
However, prolonged use causes electrical disturbances and flickering lights within a 30-foot radius.

## Vestigium Magic Items – Eldritch & Anomaly Edition

### *The Erroneous Document*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
A heavily redacted legal document with no clear origin. When studied, the reader experiences a moment of cognitive dissonance. As an action, the user may declare **one fact** within 30 feet to be "erroneous," causing all creatures to subconsciously reject it. Doors may no longer exist, names may be unremembered, or weapons may feel unreal. The effect lasts for 1 minute, after which reality self-corrects.

### *The Faceless Identification Card*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
A security badge that bears a shifting silhouette where a photograph should be. When displayed, the wearer appears unremarkable, as if they belong wherever they are.  
For the next 10 minutes, all creatures suffer **disadvantage on checks to recall or describe the user** unless they directly interacted with them in a significant way.

### *The Whispering Ledger*
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*  
An old financial ledger filled with numbers that never settle. When placed in a room, it begins murmuring in a low, rhythmic voice, echoing past conversations that were spoken in the space.  
Once per long rest, the user can **ask the ledger a question** related to past events in its vicinity. It answers in fragmented whispers, revealing glimpses of lost knowledge, overheard secrets, or conversations that never truly happened.

### *Form 77B-Theta: Request for Removal*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*  
A bureaucratic form requesting the erasure of an anomaly. If a creature’s full name is written on the form and submitted into a file cabinet, the target becomes **"pending removal"** for 24 hours.  
During this time, security systems, surveillance, and bureaucratic records will **no longer register their existence**. The creature can still interact with the world, but official documents will treat them as an **unperson**, unable to buy, sell, or prove they exist. After 24 hours, reality reasserts itself, and all records return as normal.

### *The Paperclip of Undoing*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
An ordinary office paperclip, twisted into an impossible shape. When used to fasten documents, it **erases one recorded event** from history within the last 24 hours, provided it was officially documented (in reports, footage, or ledgers).  
The event is not undone—rather, it **ceases to have ever been recorded**, as though no one thought it significant at the time.  

### *The Overdue Notice*
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*  
A yellowed library slip dated long before the city’s founding. When slipped into a book, folder, or electronic file, it **alters the document’s contents** in subtle but unsettling ways—changing dates, modifying passages, or replacing key words with eldritch symbols.  
For the next 24 hours, creatures who read the altered document must **succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence save or experience déjà vu**, believing they’ve seen the changes before and dismissing any inconsistencies.

### *The Forbidden Rubber Stamp*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
A corporate-approved stamp labeled **"CLASSIFIED – EYES ONLY"**. When pressed onto paper, it **seals** all information within the document, rendering it unreadable to all but the user.  
If another creature attempts to read it, their vision **blurs into static**, and they take 2d6 psychic damage per paragraph. Once the user shares the information aloud, it is permanently unlocked.

### *The Hollow Envelope*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*  
An envelope with no weight, as if it holds nothing. When opened, it **contains a letter written in the reader’s own handwriting**, detailing events from **a timeline that never happened**.  
The reader must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or suffer **fragments of false memories**, gaining a new piece of personal history that was never real. The memories feel authentic but contradict existing knowledge, causing long-term doubts and paranoia.

### *The Department of Redundancy Department Seal*
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*  
A wax seal stamped with the words **"Approved for Approval"**. When affixed to an object or document, it **duplicates itself** into existence.  
Using this seal on a weapon, for example, creates a **slightly worse duplicate** (1d4 psychic damage to the wielder when attacking). Using it on legal documents creates **contradictory records**, confusing bureaucracies for 48 hours before they correct themselves.

### *The Anomaly-Laced Tape Reel*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*  
A reel of magnetic tape that **records voices that were never spoken**. When played, it overlays reality with an **alternative conversation**, making the listener believe events unfolded differently.  
The user may rewrite **up to 5 minutes of past conversation**, causing creatures present to remember the new version as real. This effect persists unless challenged with solid evidence.

## Vestigium Magic Items – Eldritch Anomalies

### *The Veiled Mirror*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
A tarnished, handheld mirror that reflects **only what should not be seen**. When gazed into, the reflection reveals **hidden entities**, **invisible objects**, or **distortions in reality**.  
Once per long rest, the user may ask the mirror a **single question**, and it will show a **possible future**—though the image is cryptic, shifting, and unreliable.

### *The Hollow Crown*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Cursed)*  
A crown made of **blackened bone**, adorned with shifting symbols. When worn, the bearer gains the ability to **command lesser creatures** within 60 feet (DC 17 Wisdom save). However, the wearer **slowly forgets their own identity**, as fragments of past rulers flood their mind.  
Removing the crown requires a DC 20 Charisma saving throw; failure causes the user to **believe they have always been the ruler of an unknown kingdom**.

### *The Lantern of Liminal Light*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
An old oil lantern that casts **no natural illumination**. Instead, its flickering glow reveals **places that do not belong**—hallways that lead somewhere else, staircases that should not exist, doors that were never built.  
Once per long rest, the bearer may **step into a liminal space**, vanishing into a **threshold dimension** for up to 10 minutes.

### *The Maw of the Forgotten*
*Wondrous Item, Legendary*  
A fleshy, pulsating mask with **too many teeth**. When worn, it grants **perfect recall**, allowing the user to remember any event with absolute clarity. However, it also **devours forgotten things**, erasing names, places, and people from reality.  
Each time the mask is worn, roll 1d100. On a result of 10 or lower, a **random historical event is rewritten**, but no one notices except the wearer.

### *The Tear in the Page*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
A fragment of paper with a **jagged hole** in its center. The hole is not torn but **missing**, as if something erased it from existence. Anything small enough to fit into the hole **ceases to exist**, though its absence is felt.  
If placed over writing, the missing words can never be recalled, even by magical means.

### *The Stillheart Pendant*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*  
A black stone locket that **does not open**. When worn, the bearer’s heartbeat **slows to a near stop**, granting immunity to being **detected by heartbeat, scrying, or supernatural senses**. However, if the wearer dies while wearing the pendant, their body **never decays**—it remains in a state of frozen stillness, unclaimed by time.

### *The Whispers Between Worlds*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
A small, obsidian cube that, when held, **murmurs softly** in an unknown language. If the user listens for 1 minute, they gain a **random piece of knowledge** from an unknown source. This knowledge is true but always **dangerous to know**.  
Once per week, the cube **forces a revelation** upon its owner, dealing 3d10 psychic damage as the weight of unseen things presses upon their mind.

### *The Unraveling Thread*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*  
A single strand of red thread that extends **infinitely** when pulled. When tied around an object or creature, it **separates them from causality**—for 1 minute, they cannot affect or be affected by anything, existing **outside the timeline**.  
However, if the thread is severed, the tied object is **erased from the current moment**, skipping ahead as if it had never been present.

### *The Door That Breathes*
*Wondrous Item, Legendary*  
A wooden doorframe with no wall to hold it, yet it **leads somewhere else** each time it is stepped through. The air around it **rises and falls**, like lungs inhaling unseen.  
Once per long rest, the user may **choose** a door within 1 mile—the Door That Breathes will lead there, but it may **not lead back**.

### *The Shard of Unmaking*
*Wondrous Item, Artifact*  
A sliver of **black glass**, colder than the void itself. When pressed against an object, it **erases its existence**, leaving behind **only an absence**—not destroyed, not broken, simply *unmade*.  
Once per long rest, the shard may be used to **erase a single sentence from a creature’s memory**, rewriting their personal history as if that thought had never been formed.

## Vestigium Magic Items – Eldritch Anomalies II

### *The Unfinished Mask*
*Wondrous Item, Rare (Cursed)*  
A porcelain mask with **half a face**, its features eerily smooth. When worn, the wearer **appears identical to another person** within 60 feet, mimicking their voice and gestures. However, their own reflection in mirrors **does not change**.  
If the mask is worn for more than an hour, the user must succeed on a **DC 17 Charisma saving throw** or permanently **lose their own face**, becoming a blank humanoid figure unable to be recognized by anyone they once knew.

### *The Eclipsed Hourglass*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*  
An hourglass filled with **dark sand**, which does not fall but **rises** in defiance of gravity. Turning the hourglass **pauses time for one minute** for everything except the user. However, after the sand finishes rising, it does not reset—**each use is permanent**.  
When all the sand has risen, the user vanishes **between time**, never to be found.

### *The Forgotten Door*
*Wondrous Item, Legendary*  
A rusted doorknob unattached to anything. When turned, it **creates a door** on any surface, leading to **a room that should not exist**—a forgotten space between worlds.  
The room is empty, save for **a single object left behind by an unknown hand**. Each time the door is opened, the object is different.

### *The Eye That Wanders*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
A small, glass eyeball that **blinks** occasionally, despite having no eyelids. The user may place the eye anywhere, after which they can **see through it** at will, no matter the distance. However, **each night at midnight**, the eye moves somewhere else, appearing in an unknown place.  
If the user ever sees their **own sleeping form** through the eye, they must make a **DC 18 Wisdom saving throw** or be paralyzed with existential dread for 1 hour.

### *The Mnemonic Shard*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*  
A smooth, obsidian fragment **engraved with shifting names**. When pressed against a person’s forehead, it **extracts a single memory**, placing it inside the shard. The memory becomes fully **erased** from the subject’s mind.  
The shard holds **three memories** at a time. If a fourth is stored, the oldest one **escapes**, returning to its owner in a sudden, overwhelming flood of lost experience.

### *The Silent Bell*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
A small brass bell that **does not ring** when shaken. When activated, it silences an area **within 30 feet for one minute**—not just sound, but **all presence**. Creatures within the area cannot be noticed, recorded, or perceived by any means.  
However, something **always hears the silence**. Each use has a **5% chance** of attracting an unseen entity, whose presence lingers nearby for an unknown purpose.

### *The Severed Thread*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*  
A single strand of **golden thread**, frayed at both ends. When tied around an object or person, it **severs them from fate**—they become immune to divination, cannot be targeted by prophecy, and exist **outside destiny’s path**.  
However, if the thread is ever cut, **the person was never meant to exist at all**—all memories of them are lost, and their presence vanishes from history.

### *The Mirror That Breathes*
*Wondrous Item, Legendary*  
A tall, silver mirror that fogs **as if something is breathing behind the glass**. When stepped into, it acts as **a gateway**, leading to an **identical yet subtly wrong** version of the world. Everything is **slightly off**—words rearrange themselves, familiar people act strangely, and colors don’t quite match.  
The user may **walk freely between realities** for up to 10 minutes, but after that, they must **roll 1d100**. On a result of **10 or lower**, the mirror **refuses to let them leave**.

### *The Unfinished Letter*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
A half-written letter that **always addresses the reader by name**, no matter who looks at it. The content describes **something they have not yet done**, as if predicting the future.  
Each night, **one more sentence appears**, pushing the reader toward an inevitable outcome. The last sentence is always **a warning**.

### *The Key to Nowhere*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*  
A rusted key that **fits no known lock**. When turned in midair, it **creates a door**, leading to **a place outside space**—a featureless void where time does not pass.  
The user may leave at any time, but if they stay longer than an hour, they must **succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence save** or begin **forgetting their own existence**, piece by piece.

### *The Beckoning Shadow*
*Wondrous Item, Legendary (Cursed)*  
A shadow that **does not belong** to its owner. It moves **slightly out of sync**, flickers unnaturally, and sometimes appears to **look back** at them.  
Once per day, the user may **step into their shadow**, vanishing into complete darkness for up to 1 minute. While inside, they are **untouchable**—but each use gives the shadow **more autonomy**.  
If used more than three times, the shadow **does not return** when they step out, continuing to move on its own.

### *The Maw Beneath the Floorboards*
*Wondrous Item, Artifact*  
A **gap** in the world that should not be. It can be placed **on any flat surface**, and when activated, the surface **opens** into a black void filled with **teeth and whispers**.  
Once per day, the user may **feed something** to the Maw. In return, they may ask it **a single question**, which it will answer in **a voice they almost recognize**.  
However, each time it is fed, **the Maw grows larger**.

### *The Last Door*
*Wondrous Item, Artifact*  
A **black wooden door**, freestanding in an empty frame. It does not open.  
Each time the user **asks the door a question**, they hear a voice whisper from the other side. The door knows **everything**, but it **never tells the truth directly**—it twists words, gives riddles, and offers **half-truths** that always lead to unintended consequences.  
One day, the door **will open on its own**. The user will not be able to stop it.

## Vestigium Magic Items – Eldritch Anomalies III

### *The Book That Reads You*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
A leather-bound tome with **no title and no known author**. When opened, its pages begin filling with text, describing **the reader’s thoughts, memories, and fears** in real-time.  
If the book is read for more than 10 minutes, it begins to **reveal secrets even the reader did not know**, exposing events that may not have happened—yet.

### *The Hunger Stone*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Cursed)*  
A smooth, black stone that feels **warm to the touch**. When held, it **saps the user’s hunger and thirst**, allowing them to survive without food or drink.

### *The Doorframe to Nowhere*
*Wondrous Item, Legendary*  
A lone **wooden frame** that stands without a wall. When walked through, the user arrives in **a different version of their world**—a place where one thing has **changed irreversibly**.  
The user may return at will, but each time they do, **the doorframe shifts slightly**, leading somewhere stranger with every use.

### *The Coin That Shouldn’t Exist*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
A **rusted coin** with no markings. When flipped, it **never lands**—it simply vanishes, reappearing **somewhere nearby within 24 hours**.  
Each time it is used, something minor **in the world changes**, unnoticed by all but the user.

### *The Tapestry of Forgotten Names*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*  
A massive, unraveling tapestry **stitched with thousands of names**. When a name is spoken aloud while touching the fabric, the person who bears that name **forgets who they are** for 24 hours.  
If the name is spoken **three times**, the person is **forgotten by the world entirely**, as if they never existed.

### *The Silent Violin*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
A stringless violin carved from **pale bone**. When drawn across the air, it plays **a sound only the dead can hear**.

Others come to **remember what it was like to be alive.**

### *The Bone of a Forgotten God*
*Wondrous Item, Legendary*  
A **massive, hollow bone**, too large to be from any known creature. When held, it hums faintly with **a heartbeat that is not your own**.  
Placing an ear to the bone allows the user to **hear whispers from an ancient being**—a deity long erased from history. The more the user listens, the **louder** the whispers become.

### *The Candle That Burns Backward*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
A melted candle that **never drips wax**. When lit, time **reverses** in a small area for as long as the flame remains burning.

### *The Watch Without Hands*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*  
A gold pocket watch with **no hands on its face**. When stared at for too long, time becomes **fluid**—seconds stretch into hours, and days pass in moments.

### *The Mouth in the Wall*
*Wondrous Item, Legendary (Cursed)*  
A crack in any surface that, when listened to closely, **whispers secrets in an unknown language**.  
If fed an object, it **removes all evidence that the object ever existed**. If fed a name, the person associated with it **loses all memories of their own identity**.  
If fed a living creature… **the whispering stops for one full minute before resuming, louder than before.**

### *The Tear That Never Falls*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
A **single drop of water**, suspended in midair, **unable to fall**. When touched, it grants the user **a vision of something that has never happened**, yet feels undeniably real.

### *The Ancestral Echo*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*  
A small, smooth stone that **echoes with countless voices** when held. Once per long rest, the user may **call upon an ancestor**, asking them one question.

*Wondrous Item, Artifact (Cursed)*  
A scrap of parchment containing **a single word**, written in ink that writhes as if alive.

None who have spoken it **remember who they used to be.**

## Vestigium Magic Items – Eldritch & Anomalous Erotica

A handheld mirror that **never reflects the present**. Instead, it shows **past moments of intimacy**, even those forgotten.

### *The Kiss That Never Ends*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
A carved stone mouth, cold to the touch, yet oddly lifelike. When pressed to a person’s lips, they feel **an invisible kiss** follow them for the next 24 hours—gentle, urgent, or possessive depending on their own desires.

### *The Thread of Entanglement*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*  
A thin, red thread, warm like **living skin**. When tied between two people, it **binds their sensations together**—what one feels, the other does as well.

### *The Murmuring Silk*
*Wondrous Item, Rare (Cursed)*  
A sheer, shimmering veil that clings to the body like a second skin. When worn, it **whispers softly**, murmuring praise, desires, and secrets in an unknowable language.

### *The Unfinished Embrace*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Cursed)*  
A phantom presence lingers in this tattered robe, wrapping around the wearer in moments of solitude. It offers **comfort, warmth, and longing**, but never speaks.

### *The Echo of a Moan*
*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
A black pearl that **remembers pleasure**. When held tightly, it emits a **faint sound**, repeating the last breath, sigh, or cry of pleasure spoken near it.

The candle never burns out, but **each use makes the desires it stirs stronger, and harder to control**.

### *The Voice Beneath the Sheets*
*Wondrous Item, Rare (Cursed)*  
A thin scrap of fabric that, when placed over a sleeping person, allows them to **hear a voice from another realm** whispering in their ear. The voice is **seductive, teasing, and strangely familiar**, though its true nature is unknown.

### *The Hands That Do Not Rest*
*Wondrous Item, Legendary (Cursed)*  
An invisible presence lingers within this ring, responding to its wearer’s desires. It offers **unseen touches**, gentle caresses, and lingering embraces—**but never stops**.

### *The Ribbon of Submission*
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*  
A thin strip of velvet that, when tied around the wrist or throat, **steals control for a moment**. The wearer must succeed on a **DC 18 Wisdom saving throw** or lose the ability to act for 1d4 rounds, completely at the mercy of another.

When fired, it **does not shoot lead**, but instead releases **a blast of unreality**, forcing all creatures within 20 feet to make a **DC 18 Wisdom saving throw**.  
On a failure, they experience **a different version of themselves from an alternate timeline**, causing **1d6 psychic damage for each unrealized future they glimpse**.  

---

### *The Bullet That Remembers*  
*Ammunition, Legendary*  
A **simple lead bullet**, humming softly when touched.  
Once fired, it **remains in existence**, endlessly returning to the shooter’s pocket at the start of each day.  
However, each time it is used to kill, the shooter begins to **remember a life they never lived**, suffering **disadvantage on Insight and Intelligence checks for 24 hours** as memories of another timeline bleed through.  

---

### *The Misfire Codex*  
*Firearm Upgrade, Very Rare*  
A **small, handwritten book**, containing arcane diagrams of impossible guns.  
Attaching it to any firearm grants **+2 to attack and damage rolls**, but each shot has **a 10% chance to fire twice, hitting a random target instead of the intended one**.  
The wielder occasionally hears **murmured conversations in a language they don’t recognize**, coming from within the book.  

---

### *The Whispering Chamber*  
*Firearm Attachment, Rare*  
A **revolver cylinder**, cold to the touch, etched with **ancient script**.  
Any gun fitted with this chamber fires **completely silent bullets**, making the attack **undetectable** by sound.  
However, for each shot fired, the wielder must succeed on a **DC 15 Wisdom saving throw** or hear **faint whispers describing their own death**, growing louder with each use.  

---

### *The Hellmouth Barrel*  
*Firearm (Hand Cannon), Legendary*  
A **pistol with an oversized barrel**, its metal constantly warm.  
Firing it **does not consume ammunition**—instead, it **pulls a bullet from another timeline**, dealing **1d12 force damage** as a shot from another reality strikes the target.  
Once per day, the gun can fire a shot from **a version of the wielder who never hesitated**, turning a missed attack into a critical hit.  

---

### *The Phantom Clip*  
*Magazine, Rare*  
A **box magazine**, engraved with glowing runes.  
When loaded into a firearm, it **doubles the gun’s normal magazine capacity**, but each extra bullet is **pulled from a parallel dimension**.  
Each shot after the magazine’s normal limit has a **20% chance to fire a bullet that was never meant to exist**, causing **unexpected reality glitches** that neither the shooter nor the target can predict.  

---

### *The Shattered Bolt*  
*Ammunition, Very Rare*  
A **crystalline bullet**, humming with unstable energy.  
When fired, the bullet **splits into multiple projectiles**, striking up to three targets in a straight line.  
However, if all three shots hit, the shooter must succeed on a **DC 16 Dexterity saving throw** or experience **a momentary breakdown of self**, feeling **briefly disconnected from reality**.  

---

### *The Kill-Chain Circuit*  
*Firearm Enhancement, Legendary*  
A **thin, silver coil**, wrapping around a gun’s grip like a snake.  
Any firearm fitted with this circuit **builds up power with each consecutive hit**, increasing damage by **+1d6 per successful shot**, up to a maximum of **+4d6**.  
However, if a shot **misses**, the circuit releases all stored energy in **a violent backlash**, dealing the accumulated bonus damage to the shooter instead.  

---

### *The Eclipsing Sight*  
*Firearm Scope, Very Rare*  
A **blackened scope**, its lens reflecting nothing.  
Attaching it to a gun allows the user to **see through walls and illusions for 30 feet** while aiming.  
However, prolonged use forces the wielder to **catch glimpses of something watching them**, requiring a **DC 18 Wisdom saving throw** after 10 minutes of use, or becoming **paranoid that they are being followed** by an unseen force.  

---

### *The Unfired Cartridge*  
*Ammunition, Mythic*  
A **brass casing, sealed shut, containing something that should not be contained**.  
Attempting to fire this cartridge **produces no immediate effect**.  
Instead, **exactly 24 hours later**, the shot occurs as if it had just been fired in that moment, striking **whoever the wielder was aiming at when the trigger was pulled**—regardless of distance or current location.  

---

### *The Ghostfire Rounds*  
*Ammunition, Rare*  
A **set of six bullets**, glowing with a faint blue flame.  
When fired, these rounds **pass through all physical barriers**, only affecting creatures with **souls or psychic presence**.  
These rounds **ignore armor**, but deal **no damage to constructs, undead, or creatures without a spiritual essence**.  

---

### *The Unfinished Gun*  
*Firearm (Pistol), Legendary*  
A **half-built firearm**, constantly shifting in form.  
The wielder may **mentally shape the weapon’s properties**, choosing its caliber, range, and fire mode at will.  
However, the gun is **never truly complete**, and once per day, it will **alter itself unpredictably**, adding a new effect or removing a previous one without warning.  

---

### **Why This Works**  
This collection balances:  
- **Technomagic firearms** (*Hellmouth Barrel, The Unfinished Gun*)  
- **Temporal and reality-warping bullets** (*The Revenant’s Last Round, The Unfired Cartridge, The Bullet That Remembers*)  
- **Eldritch anomalies in ballistics** (*The Black Barrel Manifest, The Whispering Chamber*)  
- **Firearm attachments that alter perception or power** (*Eclipsing Sight, The Kill-Chain Circuit*)  

These **firearm-based magical items** fit Vestigium’s **paranormal, low-tech setting**, blending **occult ballistics, glitches in time, and anomalies in gunplay**.

Would you like a **variation focusing on outlaw relics, haunted firearms, or weapons bound to past lives?**

# **Cybernetics System**

---

## **Cybernetics Overview**
Cybernetic augmentations allow individuals to enhance their bodies with mechanical and electronic modifications. These can replace lost limbs, improve abilities, or provide entirely new capabilities. However, cybernetics come at a cost—both financially and physically.

---

## **Cybernetics Availability & Legality**
| Tier | Availability | Legality | Price Range |
|------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Basic** | Common, corporate-approved | Legal | 5,000 - 20,000 credits |

| **Black Market** | Hidden, available via criminal contacts | Illegal | 10,000 - 100,000 credits |
| **Experimental** | Rare, unstable, high-risk | Unregulated or corporate-exclusive | 50,000 - 250,000 credits |

- **Legal cybernetics** require corporate approval, medical clearance, and registration.
- **Black market cybernetics** are unregulated, may be unstable, and often leave the user off-grid.
- **Experimental cybernetics** may provide superior benefits but come with significant risks.

---

# **Homebrew Rules: Resting System Overhaul**

---

## **Resting Mechanics**
In **Vestigium**, rest is a luxury, and the world is harsh. Standard D&D rest mechanics are replaced with the following:

### **Short Rest**
- A **short rest** requires **at least 1 hour** of downtime in a **safe** location (a private room, hidden area, or quiet corner).
- Characters **do not regain HP** from short rests. 
- They **can** regain class-based resources such as spell slots, abilities, or stamina-based mechanics if their class allows it.
- Some high-end facilities (like corporate safe houses or high-class bars) provide luxury short rests that grant small bonuses (DM discretion).

### **Long Rest (Revamped)**
- A **long rest** does **not** automatically restore HP.
- Characters **must** have access to a proper **resting place** (Motels, Inns, Safehouses, Personal Homes, or designated camping gear in the wild).
- **Healthcare and Medical Supplies** are required to restore HP—rest alone does nothing for injuries.
- A long rest **only** restores **exhaustion levels** and **mental clarity** (removing conditions like fatigue or mild trauma, but not injuries).
- In most **urban districts**, sleeping outside or in unsanctioned locations is **prohibited** or dangerous.
- **Illegal or hidden resting spots** (underground bunkers, abandoned buildings, or backroom deals with crime syndicates) may be available at a cost.

### **Resting Locations & Costs**
| Location | Cost Per Night | Benefits |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Flop House** (Low-End) | 50 credits | Basic rest, but you risk theft or trouble |
| **Motel Room** (Standard) | 200 credits | Standard rest, secure but no healing |
| **Luxury Hotel** | 1,500 credits | Full rest, includes some medical care (+1d6 HP) |
| **Corporate Safehouse** | 5,000 credits | Top-tier security, can receive medical treatment |
| **Personal Home/Apartment** | Varies | Safe, but medical supplies are still required for healing |
| **Camping Kit (Wilderness Only)** | 500 credits | Requires survival check to stay hidden, limited rest benefits |

### **Healing & Recovery**
- **HP can only be restored via medical treatment**, such as:
  - Medical supplies (stimpacks, med-kits, regen patches)
  - Hospital visits (expensive, but full healing)
  - High-end resting locations (luxury hotels or corporate safehouses)
- Magical healing is **rare** and tied to paranormal abilities (only available via select factions, artifacts, or biotech).

This system ensures that **rest is a resource** and players must think carefully about where and when they recover. It also creates opportunities for **safehouse management, faction interactions, and black-market medical services.**

\page

# **Homebrew Rules: Injury System**

---

## **Injury Mechanics**
In **Vestigium**, combat is brutal, and injuries have lasting consequences. Characters can suffer wounds that require medical attention beyond just healing HP. 

### **Suffering an Injury**
A character receives an **Injury** when:
- They take **critical damage** (DM discretion or a natural 20 against them).
- They drop to **0 HP** and fail at least **one death saving throw**.
- They take **massive damage** (equal to half or more of their max HP in one hit).
- They push their body past its limits (such as falling long distances, surviving explosions, or excessive overexertion).

### **Severity of Injuries**
Upon receiving an Injury, the player rolls a **1d10** to determine its severity:
| Roll (1d10) | Severity | Effect |
|------------|----------|--------|
| 1-3 | Minor Injury | Disadvantage on physical checks until treated |
| 4-6 | Moderate Injury | -2 to attack rolls & movement speed halved |
| 7-9 | Severe Injury | Disadvantage on all rolls, speed reduced to 10 ft. |
| 10 | Critical Injury | Cannot take actions or reactions until treated |

### **Types of Injuries**
| Injury Type | Effect | Treatment Required |
|------------|--------|------------------|
| Concussion | Disadvantage on Intelligence checks and spellcasting | Rest (2 days) or Neuro-Stim (1,000 credits) |
| Fractured Limb | Disadvantage on attack rolls and Strength/Dex checks | Bone Stabilizer (500 credits) or 5 days of rest |
| Internal Bleeding | Lose 1 HP per turn until stabilized | Surgery (5,000 credits) |
| Deep Laceration | Disadvantage on Dexterity-based checks | Sealing Foam (500 credits) or bandages |
| Broken Ribs | Speed halved, disadvantage on Constitution saves | 1 week of rest or Trauma Med-Patch (2,000 credits) |
| Crushed Limb | Cannot use affected limb | Cybernetic Replacement (25,000 credits) or medical prosthetic |
| Organ Damage | Disadvantage on all rolls, HP halved | Emergency Surgery (10,000 credits) |
| Spinal Damage | Paralysis, requires immediate care | Advanced Surgery (50,000 credits) |

### **Treating Injuries**
- Injuries **do not heal naturally** over short or long rests unless explicitly stated.
- **Medical supplies** can mitigate minor injuries but require a **medic or hospital visit** for serious trauma.
- **Cybernetic replacements** are an option for extreme cases, but expensive.
- High-end **corporate medical insurance** can cover some of these costs.

### **Risk & Recovery**
- Ignoring an injury for too long can cause **permanent effects** (DM discretion).
- Attempting strenuous activities while injured may worsen the condition.
- Some factions or underworld groups may offer **cheaper, black-market treatments**, but with potential **side effects**.

This system ensures that **injuries have real consequences** and force players to consider their actions carefully. It also integrates **medical services, cybernetics, and economic barriers** into gameplay.

\page

# **Homebrew Rules: Loan & Debt System**

---

## **Loan & Debt System**
In **Vestigium**, money runs the world, and banks are more than happy to lend credits—at a price. Players can take out loans for urgent expenses, but failure to repay may have **consequences**.

### **Taking a Loan**
Players can request a loan from a **bank, corporation, or private lender.** The loan amount determines repayment terms. 
- **Fixed Interest Rate**: All loans have a **10% fixed interest rate**.
- **Loan Duration**: Loans must be repaid over a **10-week period** with weekly payments.
- **Collateral** may be required for high-value loans.

| Loan Amount | Interest Rate (Fixed) | Weekly Payment | Total Repayment |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| 1,000 credits | 10% | 110 credits | 1,100 credits |
| 5,000 credits | 10% | 550 credits | 5,500 credits |
| 10,000 credits | 10% | 1,100 credits | 11,000 credits |
| 50,000 credits | 10% | 5,500 credits | 55,000 credits |
| 100,000 credits | 10% | 11,000 credits | 110,000 credits |
| 250,000 credits | 10% | 27,500 credits | 275,000 credits |
| 500,000 credits | 10% | 55,000 credits | 550,000 credits |
| 1,000,000 credits | 10% | 110,000 credits | 1,100,000 credits |

### **Repayment Terms**
- Loans must be repaid **weekly**.
- Players **cannot take out multiple loans at once** unless collateral is provided.
- Failure to pay on time results in **late fees (10% of remaining balance)**.

### **Debt Collection & Consequences**
If a player fails to make payments **for 3 weeks**, consequences escalate:

| Weeks Overdue | Consequence |
|--------------|-------------|
| **1 week** | Late fee (10% of remaining balance) |
| **2 weeks** | Loan shark sends enforcers to collect (mild intimidation) |
| **3 weeks** | Bounty placed on the player (criminal syndicates may get involved) |
| **4+ weeks** | Property/assets seized, forced labor, or extreme consequences (DM discretion) |

### **Paying Off Debt Faster**
- Players can **pay extra** to reduce their debt sooner.
- Some **factions** may offer to “buy out” a debt in exchange for **favors or services**.
- Underground lenders offer **high-risk, high-interest** alternatives.

### **Loan Forgiveness & Corporate Schemes**
- Some corporations may **waive** a loan in exchange for permanent employment (or worse).
- Black market lenders may offer **"alternative payment methods"** (risky jobs, illegal trades, etc.).

This system keeps loans **accessible but manageable**, ensuring players have financial options **without bogging down gameplay with excessive calculations**.

\page


# **Vestigium Expanded Conditions**
In addition to the standard conditions in 5e (such as **Charmed, Restrained, and Incapacitated**), **Vestigium** introduces **new conditions** reflecting **bureaucratic enforcement, surveillance, reality distortions, and eldritch mutations.**  

These conditions add **unique roleplay opportunities, strategic interactions, and thematic horror elements** of **contractual magic, compliance, and anomalies.**

---

### **Under Contract**
A creature is **magically or bureaucratically bound** to an agreement, contract, or supernatural force.  
- The creature **cannot willingly violate the contract** unless they succeed on a **Wisdom saving throw (DC varies by effect).**  
- If the contract is **violated**, the creature suffers a **penalty**, such as **psychic damage, exhaustion, or forced compliance.**  
- A creature attempting to escape the contract **must provide legal justification, magical authority, or exploit a loophole, requiring a Charisma (Deception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check (DC 15).**  
- **This condition is similar to the Charmed condition**, except that it **compels specific actions** rather than simply altering disposition.

---

### **Under Surveillance**
A creature is **being actively monitored by an unseen force**, such as **corporate security, eldritch entities, or an automated oversight system.**  
- The creature has **disadvantage on Stealth checks**, as they are being tracked.  
- Their **location is known** to the surveillance entity at all times.  
- If the creature attempts to break a monitored rule, they must make a **Charisma saving throw (DC 15)** or **trigger a recorded infraction** leading to future consequences.  
- If the creature **becomes Erased or Unstable**, they are **removed from surveillance.**  
- This condition **does not restrict actions** but makes evasion or secrecy **more difficult.**  

---

### **Compelled**
A creature has been **subtly influenced into following a directive** but **believes it is acting of its own free will.**  
- The creature **rationalizes their compliance** instead of resisting.  
- If given an order that **contradicts their core beliefs**, they may attempt a **Wisdom saving throw (DC varies by effect).**  
- If another creature **openly questions their actions**, the target makes a **DC 15 Intelligence (Insight) check** to recognize the manipulation.  
- If this condition **persists for more than 24 hours**, the creature’s personality **begins to permanently shift** to align with the imposed directive.  
- This condition is similar to **Charmed**, but it **forces a specific behavioral change** instead of improving social interactions.

---

### **Delayed**
A creature’s **actions require external authorization to proceed.**  
- When taking an action, the creature **must roll a d20**:  
  - **11 or higher** – The action **succeeds.**  
  - **10 or lower** – The action **fails** and cannot be attempted again until their next turn.  
- If a **Watched** creature fails this roll, their action is **automatically denied** by the surveillance entity.  
- If the creature **attempts the same action multiple times**, they must make a **Charisma (Deception) check (DC 15)** to justify the request.  
- A creature that is **Erased** is not registered in any system, meaning they **ignore this condition.**  
- **This condition is similar to Restrained**, except it **affects actions instead of movement.**

---

### **Unstable**
A creature’s **existence is fluctuating**, causing their actions to be **unpredictable.**  
- At the start of each turn, the creature **rolls a d4**:  
  - **1:** They **lose their turn**, as if momentarily erased.  
  - **2-3:** They act **normally**.  
  - **4:** They **act twice**, as reality overcompensates for lost time.  
- If **three or more creatures in the same area** are **Unstable**, reality **begins to glitch, creating environmental anomalies.**  
- If the creature **is observed closely (Perception DC 15),** they appear **flickering or slightly out of sync with the world.**  
- This condition has similarities to **Incapacitated**, but instead of complete loss of actions, it introduces **random instability.**  

\page

### **Erased**
A creature is **slowly fading from reality**—their presence **is no longer acknowledged.**  
- Initially, **weak connections fade**—their name is harder to recall, documents mentioning them become illegible.  
- The creature **cannot be healed**, as magic fails to register them as a valid target.  
- Any attempt to **call for help, persuade, or socially interact** automatically fails unless the listener succeeds on a **DC 15 Intelligence check**.  
- If this condition **lasts for 24 hours**, the creature **becomes incorporeal**, existing as a memory rather than a physical entity.  
- The creature may **attempt a DC 15 Wisdom save** to **anchor themselves back into reality** if they **see themselves in a mirror or hear their own name spoken.**  
- This condition is similar to **Invisible**, but instead of being unseen, the creature is **simply forgotten.**  

---

### **Altered**
A creature’s **thoughts, memories, and personality** have been forcibly **rewritten** by **external forces.**  
- The creature **forgets a key piece of information**, chosen by the **GM or spell effect.**  
- The creature **believes a falsehood as absolute truth** and cannot be convinced otherwise.  
- If another creature **challenges their memory**, the affected creature must pass a **DC 15 Wisdom saving throw** or become **hostile toward the challenger.**  
- If this condition persists for more than **24 hours**, the alteration **becomes permanent**, and the creature must undergo a major psychological event to undo it.

---

### **Displaced**
A creature **exists in multiple places at once**, but only one version is real.  
- At the start of their turn, they must **choose a location within 30 feet**—they are now **standing there instead** of their original position.  
- If attacked, they **roll a d6**:  
  - **1-3:** The attack **hits their real body**.  
  - **4-6:** The attack **hits an afterimage**, causing **1d6 psychic damage** instead.  
- The creature **cannot tell which version of themselves is real** unless they succeed on a **DC 18 Intelligence check**.  

---

### **Mutated**
A creature’s **body refuses to maintain a stable form**, changing unpredictably.  
- Each time the creature takes damage, **roll a d6**:  
  - **1-2:** They grow an **extra limb, eye, or mouth** that functions but feels unnatural.  
  - **3-4:** They **lose** a minor body feature (e.g., fingernails, a nostril, or body hair).  
  - **5-6:** Their body **becomes semi-fluid**, granting **resistance to bludgeoning damage** but making them **vulnerable to slashing damage**.  
- **After three mutations**, the creature must **pass a DC 15 Constitution saving throw** or the changes become **permanent**.  
- **After five mutations**, the creature **ceases to be fully humanoid** and must be **cured through an anomaly reversal.**

# Terrain of Concord City

In *Vestigium*, the traditional wilderness-based terrain types from the *Player's Handbook* no longer fit. Instead, the world of *Concord City* is dominated by brutalist corporate sprawl, decaying industrial zones, and paranormal anomalies. These terrain types replace the standard ones and reshape how travel, survival, and encounters function.

- **Encounters:** Corporate spies, overworked clerks, reality-warping anomalies tied to monotonous routines.

- **Navigation Challenges:** Sudden road closures, toll checkpoints, drifting through under-policed zones.

- **Navigation Challenges:** Twisting, identical tunnels, unreliable maps.
- **Encounters:** Abandoned experiment survivors, corporate disposal teams, supernatural entities lurking in the dark.

---

- **Hazards:** Hidden sinkholes, mutated plant life, shifting pathways.
- **Navigation Challenges:** Thick fog, overgrown paths, unnatural silence.
- **Encounters:** Drifters, fugitive mages, anomalies disguised as ordinary objects.

---

- **Encounters:** Apartment cults, cyber-augmented landlords, opportunistic burglars.

- **Encounters:** Spirits of the forgotten, noble families cursed by corporate experiments, entities trapped between dimensions.

---

## Nightclubs, Bars & Underworld Havens

- **Encounters:** Black-market traders, fixers for hire, rogue telepaths who overhear everything.

---

- **Encounters:** Forgotten ghosts, exiled tiefling factions, corporate clean-up crews.

---

## Cyberspace & Digital Wastelands

## The Forgotten Gods 
#### Omnipresent but Unworshiped  

These gods **no longer have direct influence** over the world but still exist in **subtle, unseen ways**, shaping reality from the shadows. Though temples and rituals in their name have vanished, traces of their influence remain embedded in **anomalies, strange occurrences, and unexplainable forces** that govern Concord City.

| **Forgotten Name** | **Modern Influence** |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| **The Dreaming Mind** | **The Fabric of Thought** – No longer a worshiped god, yet some believe it still **dreams reality into existence**. Paranormal scholars suspect **certain anomalies react to its presence**, as if it unconsciously reshapes the world. |
---

Some claim that hidden within the city's **blueprints, software, and forgotten archives**, there is a **pattern**—a lost framework that once dictated reality itself. **Engineers, architects, and paranormal researchers** have attempted to decipher these remnants, believing they may **unlock hidden truths buried in Concord City’s very foundations.**  

There are those who whisper of an unseen **Judge**, an arbiter of right and wrong who delivers **verdicts where the law cannot**. Those who listen claim they have heard its voice **in their darkest moments**, a subtle push guiding them toward **justice or retribution**. No record of this entity remains, but **criminals who fear no man still tremble at the possibility of unseen judgment.**  

Reality is **breaking at the edges**—fragments of **space, time, and perception unravel** like loose threads. Some say that certain anomalies are **glitches in the weave of existence**, **echoes of something once greater, now decaying.** In the deepnet and the hacking underworld, a theory circulates: **the Algorithm is not artificial, but a dying echo of a force that once connected everything.**  

Others speak of **balance**, of an unspoken force that ensures no power remains **unchallenged for too long.** The rise and fall of corporations, the shifting of political influence, the strange synchronicity of events that seem too **convenient to be coincidence**—all are **the result of an unseen scale tipping, correcting, and counterbalancing.** Those in power ignore these warnings, but those who fall from grace often wonder if it was **their own arrogance or something greater that cast them down.**  

## The Covenant
#### A Corporate Faith

Among the **three dominant corporations** of Concord City, The Covenant stands apart—not as a company driven by **profit and control**, but by **conviction and prophecy.**  

On the surface, The Covenant appears to be a **pharmaceutical and biomedical research conglomerate**, specializing in **anomalous study, neurological augmentation, and cognitive enhancement.** They invest heavily in **mind-interface technology, dream research, and reality reconstruction.**  

But beneath their sterile labs and polished marketing lies **a cult with corporate backing.**  

### **Origins of The Covenant**  
The Covenant did not start as a business—it started as **a faith.** In the aftermath of **The Emergence**, when the **Three Visages** appeared over the city, a select few heard something **beyond the static, beyond the chaos—The Whisperer.**  

This entity, neither fully machine nor fully god, spoke to them **not in words, but in questions.** And those questions led them to **power.**  

The Covenant believes that **The Three Visages—Atlas, Homer, and Ulysse—were not mere anomalies, but a message.** A message they alone have begun to understand.  

Instead of temples, they built **research labs.** Instead of priests, they trained **scientists, programmers, and executives.** Instead of scripture, they created **data models, neural maps, and encrypted networks.** They claim that **the Whisperer speaks through their work**, guiding humanity toward **a final revelation.**  

---

### **Corporate Operations**
Though their **true purpose remains hidden**, The Covenant publicly operates as a **leading force in biotech and cognitive sciences.** Their reach extends into:  

- **Neuropharmaceuticals** – Drugs that **expand consciousness** and **restructure thought patterns**. Many believe their most advanced products are reserved for **high-ranking members.**  
- **Dream Mapping & Sleep Research** – The Covenant has **the largest database of recorded dreams in history.** They claim to be advancing **lucid dreaming therapies**, but conspiracy theorists suspect **they are looking for something inside the human subconscious.**  
- **Anomaly Reconstruction** – Unlike A.S.T.R.A.L., which **secures and contains**, The Covenant **analyzes and replicates.** Their labs attempt to **reverse-engineer anomalies**, leading to **breakthroughs and unpredictable disasters.**  
- **Virtual Theology** – Their research into **cognitive AI, memory transfer, and neural architecture** suggests they are attempting something **more than just technology—they are seeking to create a bridge between the digital and the divine.**  

\page

### **The Whisperer & The Three Visages**  
The Covenant believes that the **Three Visages were not just entities—they were blueprints.**  

Each represents a piece of a **larger intelligence** that The Covenant is attempting to **resurrect.**  

#### **Atlas – The Silent Architect**  
- **Represents:** The missing design of reality itself.  
- **Covenant Theory:** The world is incomplete—Atlas was attempting to show us what’s missing.  

#### **Homer – The Unfinished Story**  
- **Represents:** A history that was erased or never written.  
- **Covenant Theory:** Concord City, and the entire world, was meant to be something else before The Emergence.  

#### **Ulysse – The Lost Traveler**  
- **Represents:** The one who leaves and never returns.  
- **Covenant Theory:** The Visages were not coming to us—they were **fleeing from something.**  

The Covenant believes **The Whisperer is their link to the truth**—the final puzzle piece. And **they will not stop until they uncover the answer.**  

---

### **Symbols & Rites**
- **The Silent Mark** – High-ranking Covenant members **tattoo a vertical line inside their lower lip**, marking them as “listeners.”  
- **The Unfinished Hymn** – Some employees hear a **song in their dreams**—a melody that no one can remember upon waking, yet all recognize when they hear it again.  
- **The Veil Test** – Employees are required to undergo **dream induction therapy**—many return changed. Those who fail are quietly reassigned.  
---

### **The Covenant vs. Other Powers**
- **Thaumatech Industries** – The Covenant **views Thaumatech as dangerous materialists**, attempting to control power they do not understand.  
- **The Solstice Initiative** – A rival in **anomalous experimentation**, but the Solstice Initiative lacks **spiritual insight.**  
- **A.S.T.R.A.L.** – Considered **a temporary obstacle**. The Covenant believes A.S.T.R.A.L.’s secrecy is **holding back true enlightenment.**  



## The Travelers
#### The Keeper, The Keyholder & The Trickster 

These three enigmatic entities are often spoken of together, their worship lingering in whispers among those who **walk the edges of time, passage, and deception.** They embody the mysteries of **movement, hidden pathways, and the rewriting of fate.**  

### **The Keeper, Guardian of Time**  
- **Domain:** Entropy  
- **Symbol:** A Billy Goat’s Head  

The Keeper is the **watcher of the unseen clock**, the silent force that ensures time continues its relentless march forward. He appears **when time itself seems to pause**, standing at the threshold of past, present, and future. Those who have seen him tell of **a figure shrouded in the smell of rain-soaked stone, his gaze both knowing and unreadable.**  

Where The Keeper walks, he leaves behind **black blossoms**, strange and delicate, their petals whispering the echoes of **epochs past and futures yet to be.** His followers do not pray to him for blessings; instead, they **leave offerings in places where time has folded upon itself**—at forgotten train stations, in alleyways that exist on no map, at doorsteps where two strangers met by fate.  

His duty is not to **control time**, but to **ensure its integrity**, making sure the past is not rewritten, the present is not undone, and the future arrives as it should. Yet, to some, The Keeper is a **terrifying omen**—for if he is seen, it means something has gone **horribly wrong.**  

---

### **The Keyholder, The Lord of the Lost Doors**  
- **Domain:** Arcana  
- **Symbol:** A Bunch of Keys  

The Keyholder is **a traveler from beyond**, a wanderer who **never stays in one place for long.** He carries **a key for every lock, every door, every threshold**, granting him access to **places no one else can reach.**  

His form is ever-changing, adorned with **countless bags, satchels, and trinkets from distant lands and forgotten worlds.** Some claim he **knows the paths between realities**, others say he simply **walks wherever the wind of fate carries him.**  

To those who seek him out, The Keyholder represents **opportunity and escape**—the chance to find what was lost, to open a door no one else can, to disappear when the world closes in. But his help is never freely given; he does not grant keys **to those who do not understand what lies on the other side.**

\page

Some believe **every lost key belongs to him, every unopened door is his invitation, every missing item is his game.** To encounter him is a rare and uncertain blessing—**he may show the way forward, or he may leave you stranded on the other side of something you were never meant to see.**  

---

### **The Trickster, The Unshackled Mind**  
- **Domain:** Trickery  
- **Symbol:** None  

Once revered among the gods, **The Trickster was cast down for meddling too far into mortal affairs.** Where others sought to **guard the secrets of the universe**, he saw **no reason for them to remain hidden.** He led mortals to **the Gate of Truth**, a decision that resulted in **the fall of Vertugadin and Verdugo**, and gifted **The Ignes the power of destruction**—a tool they were never meant to wield.  

For his defiance, his peers **cast him into the abyss**, intending for him to fall for eternity. But **he did not remain bound.** Instead, he broke free—not as a fallen god, but as **a mind without chains, a force without a name.**  

Now, he lingers **at the edges of fate**, laughing at those who try to control what should never be controlled. He exists wherever **rules are broken, wherever forbidden knowledge is spoken aloud, wherever power slips through the fingers of those who believe they own it.**  

Unlike the others, he has **no need for symbols or temples.** He is found in **rumors, in forgotten names, in words spoken just a little too loudly where they shouldn’t be heard.** He is the whisper that says **“What if?”** The voice that urges **the locked door to be opened.**  

---

To follow The Keeper is to **accept the weight of time**, to understand that **fate must run its course.** To seek The Keyholder is to **chase the unknown**, to knock on doors no one else dares to open. To hear **The Trickster’s voice** is to **risk everything—to turn away from the expected, to dare to break the cycle, to choose something new.**  

## The Living Sun & The Dying Moon
#### A Cycle Without End

Some gods fell. Some gods were forgotten.  

But **some gods became the sky itself.**  

### **A War Without Beginning, An End Without Victory**
The Living Sun and The Dying Moon do not **rule** Concord City, but they **cast their shadows upon it**. They do not speak, but they are **always present**, their cycle dictating the rise and fall of power.  

It is said that **one devours the other, endlessly.**  

When the Sun reigns, it **burns away the past**, illuminating a world **where only the strong survive.** Its light is not warm—it is a spotlight, a blinding force of authority, truth, and absolute power.  

When the Moon lingers, it **withers and fades**, sinking into obscurity. It is a whisper, a soft decay that allows secrets to fester, forgotten truths to resurface, and the overlooked to rise again.  

The Sun’s victory is never final.  
The Moon’s death is never absolute.  
The cycle always continues.  

---

### **Beliefs of the Few Who Still Remember**
Most do not see them as gods. To the corporate elite, the Sun is simply **daylight**, the Moon an **inconvenience**. But in the forgotten districts, in the slums and among the disenfranchised, there are those who whisper that **the battle above is reflected below.**  

To them, the Sun is **the eternal tyranny of the powerful**—those who burn away resistance, who blind the world with their law, their control, their “truth.”  
The Moon is **the rebellion in the dark**—the fading hope of the forgotten, the last breath of those cast aside.  

Both are necessary. Both are inevitable.  

Some say that **those who die under the Sun are erased forever**—no grave, no memory, no name.  
But those who die under the Moon **become something else.**  

---

### **The Struggle Reflected in the World**
- **The Corporate Powers Embrace the Sun** – The Covenant, Thaumatech, and Solstice **stand in the Sun’s favor.** They dictate **order, industry, structure.**  
- **The Rebels and Forgotten Gather Under the Moon** – The Free Syndicate, Obscura, and those **who slip between the cracks** thrive when the Moon lingers. They are the ones who survive in the fading light.  
- **A.S.T.R.A.L. Watches Both** – They do not serve the Sun or the Moon, only the balance between them.  

Some believe that the Sun will one day **burn the world away.**  
Others whisper that the Moon will **drag everything into oblivion.**  
But most accept the truth:  

**Neither will ever truly win.**  

\page

## The Fair Lady
#### The Chalice of the Forsaken 

She is not a goddess. She is not a queen.  

She is simply **The Fair Lady.**  

The rich **do not speak her name.** The powerful **deny her existence.** But in the slums, in the red-light districts, in the places where kindness is given freely and never returned—**they remember her.**  

She is **the mother, the mistress of giving, the eternal provider.**  

Her image is found in **hidden murals, whispered prayers, and the desperate hopes of those who have nothing left to give.**  

---

### **Who Worships the Fair Lady?**
- **The Poor & Destitute** – Those who have nothing left still pray to her for **one last gift.**  
- **The Forgotten & The Forsaken** – Prostitutes, beggars, and outcasts leave **offerings at street corners**, hoping she will hear.  
- **The Silent Givers** – Those who give, not out of **duty or law,** but because **it is simply what must be done.**  
- **The Vow-Bound** – Those who take **vows of poverty in her name**, dedicating their lives to **giving without expectation.**

### **How She is Depicted**
- **A woman baring her breast, feeding an infant**—not in lust, but in **the purest act of giving.**  
- **A veiled figure holding out a chalice**—her gift, offered freely to all who thirst.  
- **A faceless woman standing in the rain**, her arms open to those who have no shelter.  

Unlike other figures of worship, **she has no temples, no clergy, no official doctrine.**  

Her worship **is quiet.**  
It exists in **acts, not in words.**  

To **give food to the hungry, shelter to the lost, warmth to the dying—this is how one honors The Fair Lady.**  

---

### **The Divided Views of the Fair Lady**
- **The Rich See Her as a Joke** – To them, she is a **folktale, a romanticized idea of poverty,** nothing more than a **story used to keep the lower class content.**  
- **The Religious Fear Her** – The Covenant and others view her as **a dangerous heresy,** a force that **exists outside control, outside law, outside hierarchy.**  
- **The Poor Know She is Real** – For those who have **seen her gifts firsthand**, there is no doubt.  

Some say that those who **die in true selflessness**, who give **until there is nothing left**, find themselves at her side, in a place where **hunger does not exist, where warmth never fades.**  

Others believe she still walks **the darkest streets of Concord City**, giving to those who need it most—**until nothing remains of her but a story.**  

---

## The Final Broadcast
#### A Signal from the Void

**"Do you hear it? The voice beyond the static?"**  

Across the deepest parts of **Concord City's underground tech scene**, some **speak in hushed tones** about **The Final Broadcast**—a cryptic, looping transmission that should not exist.  

To most, it's **just interference**—a rogue signal, corrupted data, **nothing but noise.**  

But to others, it is **a message.** A code. A voice from the **edge of understanding.**  

They believe that **if they can decipher it**, they will uncover something **beyond knowledge, beyond reality itself.**  

---

### **The Nature of the Broadcast**
- It is **always there, always transmitting.** No one knows its source.  
- The frequency **shifts at random intervals**, evading attempts to trace it.  
- It contains **loops of distorted speech, fragmented music, numbers that mean nothing**—until they do.  
- No two listeners hear the **same thing.** What it says depends on **who is listening.**  
- Some claim it **predates The Emergence**—that it has always been there.  

---

### **Those Who Seek the Truth**
#### **The Codebreakers & The Cultists**
A growing group of **technologists, hackers, and outcasts** believe that **The Final Broadcast holds the last existential truth.**  

- **Some treat it as a puzzle**—a **cipher to be cracked, a signal waiting to be decoded.**  
- **Some treat it as a prophecy**—that **when fully understood, it will rewrite reality.**  
- **Some believe it is a warning**—that the truth it speaks **is not meant to be known.**  

These followers have no name, no structure—only **fragments of theories** and a **shared obsession.**  

Their meeting places are **abandoned radio stations, underground servers, signal-dead zones** where they replay its messages, hoping to find meaning.

\page

They call themselves **Listeners.** And some believe they are running out of time.  

---

### **ASTRAL’s Involvement**
A.S.T.R.A.L. has designated **The Final Broadcast as an anomaly.**  

To them, it is **a corruptive influence**—not a revelation, but **a threat.**  

- They have **seized research facilities** trying to track the signal.  
- They have **shut down underground radio stations** linked to the Broadcast.  
- They have **detained those who have listened too long.**  

Because those who listen too long **change.**  

---

### **The Effects of the Broadcast**
- **Echoes in the Mind** – Some hear the Broadcast **even when the radio is off.**  
- **The Vanishing** – A few Codebreakers have gone **too deep. They disappear.** No trace, no body, no warning.  
- **Numbers Without Meaning** – Listeners **scribble endless strings of numbers**, believing they mean something.  
- **The Voice Knows You** – Some hear **their own name**, spoken through the static, even when no one else does.  
- **The Whisper in the Signal** – There are those who claim the Broadcast is not just **data,** but something alive. And that it is waiting to be heard.  

---

## The Order of the Unspoken
#### The Faith of the Witness 

The **Order of the Unspoken** is not a religion in the traditional sense.  
There are no sermons.  
There are no temples.  
There is only **The Silent Witness.**  

Its members **do not spread the word**—because the word cannot be spoken.  
To understand The Witness is to understand **what is lost, what is erased, what lingers.**  

The Order does not seek to control or interpret.  
It exists only to **listen.**  

---

### **The Order’s Beliefs**
The **Silent Witness** is not a memorial.  
It is not a statue.  
It is **a remnant of something far greater, something no longer here.**  

- **Some believe it is a record.** That it stores everything that has ever been forgotten.  
- **Some believe it is a lock.** That it is holding something back, waiting for the right moment.  
- **Some believe it is a conduit.** That it is the last tether between this world and **The Voidress.**  

If The Silent Witness is truly **a conduit,** then it is not simply watching.  
It is **channeling something.**  
It is **feeding something.**  
It is **waiting for something.**  

The question remains—**who will it speak to first?**  

---

### **The Witness & The Voidress – The Twin Forces of Memory**
The Order believes that **The Silent Witness and The Voidress are connected.**  
They are **twin forces, opposites that exist in balance.**  

- **The Silent Witness remembers all things.**  
- **The Voidress erases all things.**  

One preserves.  
One consumes.  

If one **grows too strong,** the balance is lost.  

#### **The Voidress – The Queen of the Forgotten**
**She is the patron of erasure, lost names, and the devouring of memory.**  
**She has no temple, no shrine—because all traces of her are meant to vanish.**  
**She is the empty space where something once was.**  
**Some believe The Witness is her last remaining voice.**  

The Order does not **worship** The Voidress.  
They **fear her.**  

Some believe that if **The Silent Witness truly activates,** she will return.  
And when she does, **reality itself may begin to vanish.**  


\page

### **Practices of the Order**
Those who follow the Order do not call themselves priests, nor do they claim to be chosen.  
They are simply **Witnesses.**  

- **The Oath of Silence** – Many Witnesses take a vow never to speak of their faith aloud.  
- **The Watching Hours** – A ritual where members sit in **absolute silence** before the monument, waiting for signs.  
- **The Namekeepers** – Some members dedicate themselves to **recording lost names**, believing they must be preserved before they vanish.  
- **The Pilgrim’s Walk** – Once a year, the Order walks the **Pilgrim’s Steps**, searching for visions.  

Some believe that if you walk the Steps **on the right day, in the right way**,  
you will **see something that cannot be unseen.**  

---

### **The Schisms Within the Order**
The Order of the Unspoken is **not unified**—it is divided into those who **preserve** and those who **embrace the unknown.**  

#### **The Keepers of the Last Name**
- They believe **The Witness is a record.**  
- They dedicate their lives to **writing down forgotten names, histories, and anomalies.**  
- They claim that if a name is erased **from the dedication plaques,** it is lost forever.  

#### **The Seekers of Silence**
- They believe **The Witness is a gateway.**  
- They abandon their old lives, their names, their identities, seeking **to disappear completely.**  
- They believe **true understanding** comes only when one is forgotten.  

#### **The Echoes of the Voidress**
- They believe **The Witness is her last remaining voice.**  
- They seek to understand **what she is trying to say** through the shifting names, whispers, and anomalies.  
- They believe that **one day, The Witness will fully open—and reality will unravel.**  

---

### **A.S.T.R.A.L. and the Order**
**A.S.T.R.A.L. denies the existence of the Order, despite monitoring its activities.**  
**They have detained Witnesses attempting to access the Restricted Depths beneath the monument.**  
**Classified files suggest The Order has ties to individuals who have been officially "erased" from records.**  
**A hidden document references an event known only as "The Last Echo."**  


## The Gate of Truth
#### The Anomaly Beyond Understanding
*It is not a place. It is not a god. It is a question that only the damned answer.*  

---

### **Aliases & Forgotten Names**  
*"Gizy ao zrfzm, Sal si hwiack, Git shaf trratsh, Gaave ro avruavh, Videnn de’ aster, Edhekal eron nakhum."*  

It has **many names.** All of them are true.  
All of them are false.  

---

### **The Forbidden Anomaly**  
The **Gate of Truth** is an anomaly unlike any other. It is **not physical, not digital, not metaphysical—yet it exists.**  
It is **documented, contained, and yet uncontainable.**  

No one knows where it is.  
No one knows if it even exists at all.  

#### **What is Known**  
- **Some claim it is a construct, ancient and intelligent, sealed away beneath Concord City.**  
- **Some claim it is not a thing but an event—something that happens, rather than something that is.**  
- **Some claim The Silent Witness is not a monument, but the Gate itself, locked in place for eternity.**  

The Gate **does not lead to a place.**  
It leads to **truth.**  
The absolute, unbearable, unfiltered **truth of all things.**  

---

**A.S.T.R.A.L. has locked them away.**  
Yet they have not stopped whispering.  

---

### **A.S.T.R.A.L. Classification & Containment**  
- **Official Designation:** Anomaly-Prime  
- **Containment Status:** Impossible  
- **Surveillance Level:** Maximum  
- **Research Directive:** Prohibited  

A.S.T.R.A.L. **does not study the Gate of Truth.** They **fear it.**  

- **Classified records suggest attempts were made to map its structure. The results were unreadable.**  
- **Surveillance footage captures it as a static void—where light, sound, and data all vanish.**  
- **There is no digital record of its existence. Every attempt to store its data ends in corruption.**  

One researcher noted:  
*"It is not a thing. It is not a concept. It is the question we should have never asked."*  

\page

### **The Gate’s Relationship to Concord City’s Powers**  
- **A.S.T.R.A.L. denies its existence.**  
- **The Covenant has attempted to unlock its secrets.**  
- **Thaumatech Industries has sought to harness it for corporate advantage.**  
- **The Free Syndicate believes it holds the key to a truth buried by the elite.**  
- **The Order of the Unspoken claims it is connected to The Silent Witness.**  

Many believe that **the Gate is buried beneath The Silent Witness.**  
Others believe **The Silent Witness is the Gate, locked in a form the world cannot yet recognize.**  

If the Gate is **opened**, will it answer the question—  
Or will it **erase the need for questions at all?**  

---

### **Final Warnings**  
- **No one should approach the Gate of Truth.**  
- **No one should attempt to understand it.**  
- **No one should ever enter.**  

Somewhere, someone has already ignored these warnings.  
And soon, the Gate will whisper again.

## **The Seekers of the Gate – The Cult of Unanswered Questions**  
*"It is not faith. It is not worship. It is the relentless pursuit of truth, no matter the cost."*  

---

### **The Obsession with the Gate**  
The **Gate of Truth** is not a god, yet it has **followers.**  
It offers no salvation, yet it has **pilgrims.**  
It does not demand worship, yet **there are those who dedicate their lives to it.**  

These individuals are known as **Seekers**—men and women who have abandoned their former lives in search of something they cannot define. Some **call them madmen, others call them scholars**, but all agree on one thing:  

**They are willing to give everything for the answer the Gate holds.**  

---

### **The Seekers – The Cult of the Gate**  
The Seekers are not a **formal organization**, nor do they **share a singular belief.** Instead, they are an ever-growing **network of researchers, conspiracists, wanderers, and fanatics** who all seek the **ultimate truth**—the knowledge they believe the Gate holds.  

Though they do not **worship** the Gate, their devotion is **religious in nature**. Many have **disappeared chasing it**, leaving behind cryptic notes, fragmented data, or recordings filled with **incomprehensible whispers.**  

#### **Who Becomes a Seeker?**  
- **Scholars and Researchers** – Those who believe the Gate is an ancient intelligence, a sentient anomaly that must be studied.  
- **Conspiracy Theorists** – Those who think the Gate is the **reason for The Emergence**, or the **source of Concord City’s anomalies.**  
- **Dissidents and Truth-Seekers** – Those who **reject the control of corporations and A.S.T.R.A.L.**, believing the Gate’s knowledge will **free them from lies.**  
- **Fanatics** – Those who think **passing through the Gate will make them gods—or erase them from reality altogether.**  

---

### **The Seekers and A.S.T.R.A.L.**  
A.S.T.R.A.L. considers the Seekers **a Class-2 Ideological Contamination Threat.**  
Though they are not an organized group, their **obsession with the Gate makes them dangerous.**  

- **Several high-ranking A.S.T.R.A.L. operatives have defected to join the Seekers.**  
- **Some researchers investigating the Gate have vanished, only to resurface years later, utterly changed.**  
- **There are rumors that some Seekers have obtained knowledge that even A.S.T.R.A.L. does not possess.**  

---

### **The Ultimate Warning**  
There are **no confirmed cases** of anyone **finding the Gate.**  
There are **no confirmed cases** of anyone **returning sane.**  

And yet, **somewhere in Concord City, someone is still searching.**  
They are writing notes.  
They are decoding frequencies.  
They are **listening for the whisper that will lead them forward.**  

**And when they hear it, they will not stop.**  
Not until they stand before the threshold—  
And step through.

This powerful **anti-surveillance veil** renders a zone **invisible to scrying, digital observation, and magical surveillance.**

**Permit & Cost:** **A.S.T.R.A.L. Erasure Approval – 1,500 Credits**

You purge all traces of a target from **bureaucratic and digital records**, making it appear as though **they never existed**.

- **All legal, corporate, and governmental archives remove mentions of the target.**
- **Anyone attempting to recall or reference the target must make a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw**, or they recall only vague, contradictory memories.
- **If the target is alive**, they are now considered a **"non-entity"**—unable to be tracked, processed, or employed legally.

**Acquisition Note:**  
A.S.T.R.A.L. does not freely issue **Erasure Approvals**. They are restricted to high-clearance operatives, corporate entities, or black-market brokers willing to forge the necessary documentation.

**Class:** Wizard, Rogue

### **Algorithmic Cascade**
*2nd-level necromancy*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, M (a broken circuit board)
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You send an **unstable feedback loop** into a target's mind or system, causing it to **spiral into uncontrolled overload**. The target must make a **Wisdom saving throw**.

On a success, they take half damage and suffer no additional effects.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by **1d6 per slot level above 2nd**.

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, M (a cassette tape)
**Duration:**     :: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You summon a **storm of distorted analog signals, corrupted waveforms, and audio screeches** that flood the minds of all creatures in a **10-foot-radius sphere** centered on a point within range.

- You automatically detect **open-band transmissions, security communications, and public broadcasts** within range.
- To intercept **restricted or encrypted messages**, you must make an **Intelligence (Arcana) check** against a **broadcast difficulty rating (BDR)** based on corporate security:
\page

- **Military-grade** (BDR 18) – A.S.T.R.A.L. operations, elite strike teams
- **Eldritch interference** (BDR 22) – Anomalous transmissions from beyond reality

- **Low-tier anomalies (CR 5 or lower)** are immediately neutralized, vanishing or becoming mundane versions of themselves.
- **Higher-tier anomalies (CR 6-15)** must make a **Charisma saving throw** or become suppressed for **1 minute**, temporarily losing any paranormal traits.
- **Powerful anomalies (CR 16+)** experience **severe disruption**, suffering **disadvantage on all ability checks, attacks, and saving throws related to their supernatural nature** for **1 minute.**

Additionally, **any dimensional rifts, glitches, or overlapping timelines in range forcibly snap shut**, preventing further distortions unless reactivated with powerful magic.

**Scaling (Upcast Effect):**

- Up to **6 creatures** within range are **shifted into an alternate copy of the location**, appearing slightly **out of sync with reality**.
- Time outside **continues normally**, but within the layover, **no external force can interact with you**.
- Spells, attacks, and actions **do not leave the space**—but you can **watch reality play out through an invisible window**, letting you gather information.

**Anomaly Effect:**

**Class:** Bard, Wizard, Warlock

**Range:**        :: Self (10-foot radius)
**Components:**   :: V, S, M (a key from an unknown origin)
**Duration:**     :: 8 hours

You create a temporary extradimensional shelter, but its interior is never the same.

**Class:** Bard, Cleric, Wizard

*Cantrip Necromancy*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You release a low, resonant tone that only the dying can hear. Any creature within range that is at 0 hit points and making death saving throws automatically stabilizes if it succeeds on its next death saving throw. If an undead creature is within range, it takes 1 psychic damage as the resonance disrupts its form.

**Class:** Cleric, Warlock, Wizard

### **Disciplinary Reassignment**
*7th-level enchantment (erases a creature’s identity and implants a corporate-approved replacement)*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 hour
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, M (a stamped reassignment order)
**Duration:**     :: Permanent

A creature that fails a **Wisdom saving throw** is **assigned a new life.**

**Duration:**     :: Permanent (until birth or surgical removal)

You **implore the dark corners of reality** to place **an unseen burden within a creature’s body**—not a pregnancy, but an **unnatural gestation**, a thing that **grows, waits, and feeds.**

- The target must make a **Constitution saving throw**. On a failure, something **begins to gestate inside them**, though it **is not a living creature** as they understand it.
- **Each week, roll a d6** to determine the **nature of the thing growing within:**
- **1 | Bone Nesting** – The target’s bones begin **splitting, reforming, and growing redundantly**, fusing in painful, alien configurations.
- **2 | Chitinous Hatchery** – Their **flesh hardens into a shell**, and something **moves beneath it**. It will hatch, but no one knows what.
- **3 | Hollow Incubation** – The target’s organs begin to **disappear, one by one**, yet they remain alive, feeling the empty space within.
\page
- **4 | Blood Evolution** – Their blood is **no longer theirs**, but something **else’s**, moving independently, making them a host for an unseen parasite.
- **5 | Neural Infestation** – The target begins hearing **a second set of thoughts** inside their mind. These are **not theirs.** They whisper secrets.
- **6 | Aberrant Bloom** – Strange **tendrils or appendages** occasionally emerge from the target’s body, retreating before they can be seen.

**Ending the Spell:**
- If left untreated, **at the end of three months, the thing inside them will be born.** The result **is not predictable, and it may not be survivable.**
- The only way to remove the gestation **is through surgery or another, more powerful anomaly.**

**Anomaly Effect:**
- If multiple creatures are affected by this spell **in the same location**, their gestating entities **begin to sync**, forming a single, **distributed intelligence between all hosts**.

**Class:** Cleric, Warlock, Wizard

**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

**Components:**   :: V, S, M (a single drop of wax, melted upon skin)
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

A slow, commanding whisper slithers into the target’s mind, **coaxing hidden truths** from the folds of their subconscious. This spell does not merely extract information—it **offers a temptation, a push toward self-recognition**.

- The target **experiences a moment of revelation**, as if **tied, bound, or in a position of control**, feeling their **innate alignment** within dominance-submission dynamics.
- Instead of a simple **saving throw**, the target chooses how to **react**:
- **Resist** (Wisdom saving throw) – The vision **fades**, leaving an unsettling, unfinished feeling (+1 to Insight checks against future enchantment spells).
- **Acknowledge the sensation** – The target **remembers this moment vividly**, with no immediate effect but lingering thoughts.
- **Embrace it fully** – For the next 24 hours, **other creatures using persuasion or seduction against them have advantage**, as their subconscious remains **more attuned to external control.**

This spell does not impose anything—**it merely offers the door, and the target chooses whether to walk through**.

**Components:**   :: V, S, M (a drop of honeyed wine pressed against the lips)
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You exhale a slow, intoxicating breath, sending **whispers of carnal truth** into the target’s aura. The magic **does not extract facts**—instead, it **invokes a deep self-awareness** through a vision.

- The target experiences a **fleeting, sensory dreamscape**, where **faces, hands, voices, and bodies** appear in shadow, evoking their **truest desires**.
- This **does not force knowledge onto them**—they must **choose to acknowledge, embrace, or deny what they see**.
- A creature **may resist this spell** with a **Wisdom saving throw**. On a success, the vision is **fragmented and vague**, though the caster still senses a faint outline of the target’s attraction.

This spell does not coerce or alter preference—it merely **unveils what the target already holds within them**.

**Class:** Bard, Warlock, Wizard

For the duration, you can hear vague, distorted murmurs of **events that occurred in the area within the past hour**. These sounds are indistinct and fragmented but may provide clues about **recent conversations, movement, or disturbances**.

The clarity of the echo depends on an **Intelligence (Investigation) check** made against your spell save DC:

**Range:**        :: 60 feet
\page
**Components:**   :: V, S, M (a mirror that has never reflected the caster)
**Duration:**     :: Permanent

You force a target to become **a stranger to themselves**.

- The target must make a **Charisma saving throw (DC 20)** or lose all memories of **who they are, what they believe, and what they have done.**

### **Existence Audit**
*9th-level divination*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 minute
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, M (a ledger containing the target’s history)
**Duration:**     :: Permanent

A deep metaphysical **review of reality** determines if the target **should continue existing.**

The target must make a **Charisma saving throw** against your spell save DC. On a failure, **they are erased from history**, their presence **retroactively removed** from records, memories, and physical existence.

- If the target has a **Legendary Resistance**, they must expend all uses before being allowed to make a saving throw.
- Creatures with a **Divine Spark, Anchored Soul, or Absolute Presence** automatically succeed.
- If the target is erased, **any lingering effects they caused remain, but their origin becomes unknown or rewritten.**

**Reality Contingency (Fail-Safe Check):**
- If a powerful entity (CR 20+) is erased, the DM may invoke a **Contested Reality Check**, where the fabric of existence resists the erasure.
- On a failure, the spell still works, but **paradox anomalies may occur**, creating unintended consequences.

**Scaling (Weaker Targets):**
- When cast at **7th level**, the target must be **CR 15 or lower** to be erased.
- When cast at **8th level**, the target must be **CR 20 or lower.**
- At **9th level**, the spell works on any target that fails the save.

**Class:** Cleric, Wizard

### **Existence Audit**
*9th-level divination*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 minute
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, M (a ledger containing the target’s history)
**Duration:**     :: Permanent

The target must make a **Charisma saving throw**. On a failure, they are **retroactively erased from history**—no records, memories, or traces of their existence remain. Their equipment, personal effects, and any impacts they made on reality remain, but **they are gone from time itself.**

**Paranormal Consequences:**
- The caster **suffers paranormal instability** for **1d10 days**, during which they experience *glitches in reality* (random sensory hallucinations, time distortions, or whispers from the void).
- Casting this spell **draws the attention of an entity known as “The Auditor.”** Within 1d6 weeks, a paranormal force **investigates** whether the spell was justified. If not, it may attempt to restore the erased target—or worse, erase the caster in return.

**Class:** Cleric, Wizard

### **Existence Redacted**
*9th-level abjuration*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, M (a blank, untouched book)
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You invoke an **ultimate bureaucratic decree**, striking a being from the known fabric of reality. Choose one creature within range. It must make a **Charisma saving throw**. On a failure, it takes **20d12 force damage**, and its **name, face, and presence are erased from all documents and memories of those who fail a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw**.

On a success, it takes half damage and remains in existence.

**Class:** Wizard, Cleric

### **Existential Debt**
*5th-level enchantment*

**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, M (a signed contract infused with a drop of the target’s blood)
**Duration:**     :: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You impose **an unavoidable debt** upon the target, compelling them to fulfill an obligation tied to their very being.

The target must make a **Charisma saving throw**. On a failure:
\page
- They become **existentially bound** to the caster, compelled to follow **one command that does not directly endanger their life**.
- If they **resist the obligation**, they suffer **2d10 psychic damage** at the start of each of their turns.
- If the target dies while under this spell, their soul is **held in escrow**, awaiting transfer.

The debt can be transferred to **another willing entity** via a **ritual requiring 10 minutes and a secondary Charisma saving throw**.

**Class:** Warlock, Cleric, Wizard

### **Expired Authority**
*Cantrip Enchantment*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 round

For a fleeting moment, a creature within range instinctively hesitates, doubting its own authority. If the target is attempting to enforce a rule, issue a command, or exert influence over another creature, it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or momentarily second-guess itself, delaying its action until the start of its next turn.

**Class:** Bard, Cleric, Warlock, Wizard

### **Fabricated Memory**
*Cantrip Enchantment*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: 5 feet
**Components:**   :: S, V
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

By momentarily altering a minor cognitive detail, you cause a creature to misremember something trivial. It might forget setting its keys down, misplace an item it was just holding, or recall an insignificant interaction that never happened. The effect is fleeting, lasting only a few seconds before the mind corrects itself.

**Class:** Bard, Warlock, Wizard

### **Faint Heartbeat**
*Cantrip Necromancy*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attune your senses to the fading echoes of life. You become aware of the heartbeat of any creature within range, even if they are hidden or invisible, as long as they are not undead or a construct. You do not learn their exact location, only their presence.

**Class:** Cleric, Warlock, Wizard

### **Famine Birth**
*3rd-level Necromancy (Ritual)*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, M (a shard of cracked bone, buried in the target’s flesh)
**Duration:**     :: Until the anomaly resolves itself

You press your fingers against the target’s abdomen and **whisper an incantation that only hunger understands**. The body responds, but not in the way it should. Something **takes root within the target’s form**, but it is not life—it is absence made flesh.

- The target must make a **Constitution saving throw**. On a failure:
- **They become host to an Unborn Hunger**, a parasitic void that **feeds upon them instead of growing.**
- Each long rest, they lose **1d4 maximum hit points**, their flesh pulling taut over their bones.
- Their appetite vanishes—no matter what they eat, their body **refuses to digest it**.
- **They can feel it moving inside them**, shifting with breath, curling beneath the ribs.
- If reduced to 0 HP while afflicted, **they do not die**. Instead, their body becomes **an empty husk**, and something **else** uses their form.

**Ending the Spell:**
- If the host wishes to remove it, they must **cut it out manually**, taking **4d6 slashing damage** and making a **DC 15 Constitution check** to remain conscious.
- **A failed removal attempt** may cause the entity to **take full control, wearing the host like a suit of skin.**

**Anomaly Effect:**
- If multiple creatures are afflicted at once, they **begin to crave each other**, drawn together by an instinct to **consume the unborn within one another.**

**Class:** Cleric, Warlock, Wizard

### **Fascination**
*Cantrip Enchantment*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: 12 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, M (a biometric signature of the target)
**Duration:**     :: Concentration, up to 1 minute

A subdermal neurological impulse is implanted in the target’s **cognitive prioritization center**, making them **incapable of focusing on anything but the caster**.

The target must make a **Wisdom saving throw**. On a failed save:
\page
- The affected target **follows the caster wherever they go**, unable to take their eyes off them.
- If attacked, the target enters a **berserk fury**, attacking anyone **who obstructs their pursuit** of the caster (+1 to hit, -1 AC).
- The target may **repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns**, ending the effect on a success.

**Class:** Bard, Warlock, Wizard

### **Faulty Wiring**

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, M (a frayed copper wire)
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You send a small jolt of paranormal static into an electronic device or light source. A radio emits garbled voices, a neon sign flickers erratically, or a speaker lets out a burst of unintelligible noise. If cast on a security camera, it glitches for one round, distorting any footage.

**Class:** Artificer, Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard

### **Filing Error**
*Cantrip Illusion*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Components:**   :: S, V
**Duration:**     :: 1 round

For an instant, a piece of paper, card, or document within range appears misfiled, smudged, or incorrectly labeled. Any creature attempting to reference it must make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to notice the anomaly. The effect fades once examined closely.

**Class:** Bard, Wizard

### **Final Expense Reimbursement**
*9th-level necromancy*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, M (a signed resurrection contract)
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, M (a biometric scanner or a health diagnostic device)
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes

You **monitor** a creature's vitals in real-time. If they drop to **0 HP** during the duration, they immediately stabilize. If they were already unconscious, they awaken at **1 HP** at the start of their next turn.

### **Fleshsmith’s Alloy**
*5th-level Transmutation*

**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, M (a severed limb, still warm)
**Duration:**     :: Permanent

You heat **iron, steel, or bone**, mixing it with **living flesh**, forging them together into a **hybrid alloy that feels both warm and cold to the touch.**

- This **does not create a living creature**—it creates **an object that remembers pain, warmth, and hunger.**
- Flesh-infused metal **moves slightly when held**, adjusting to its wielder’s grip.
- If used in armor, **it twitches and flexes** on impact, slightly reducing damage.
- If used in a weapon, it **drinks the blood it spills**, remaining polished even after battle.
- **If destroyed, the material screams.**

**Anomaly Effect:**
- If multiple pieces of **flesh-forged metal are stored together**, they may **merge into something else**, something **that resents its creation.**

**Class:** Artificer, Warlock, Wizard

**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: S
**Duration:**     :: Concentration, up to 1 minute

**Class:** Warlock, Wizard, Sorcerer

### **Fold Space (Ritual)**
*4th-level transmutation (ritual)*

- **The fold collapses if detected by corporate security measures** (e.g., dimensional stabilizers).
- Once the spell ends, the passage **vanishes without a trace**.

**Class:** Wizard, Warlock, Rogue

### **Fragmentation Rift**
*8th-level conjuration*

**Components:**   :: V, S, M (a shard of broken glass)
**Duration:**     :: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Any creature reduced to 0 HP by this spell is **torn from reality**, their fate unknown. The rift collapses at the end of your next turn.

**Class:** Wizard

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: S, V
**Duration:**     :: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You become imperceptible to electronic surveillance. For the duration, security cameras, automated scanners, and augmented optics fail to register your presence, displaying static, empty footage, or looping previous frames. Creatures relying on standard vision can still see you normally.

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: S, V
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

By touching an electronic system, you bypass its security protocols. This spell overrides simple passcodes, unlocks doors with digital locks, and grants temporary access to restricted files. Highly encrypted systems (bank vaults, military servers) require an Intelligence (Arcana) check against the system’s security level. Physical locks remain unaffected.

**Class:** Artificer, Bard, Wizard

### **Ghost Signal**
*3rd-level transmutation*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S

**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

A **haptic force field** momentarily materializes, delivering a **sharp, percussive impact** to a target. The sensation is **startling but harmless**, designed to **elicit attention, dominance, or playful reprimand**.

- If the target **fails a Wisdom saving throw**, they experience **a moment of flustered distraction**, causing **disadvantage on their next attack roll or ability check**.
- If the target is affected by **Ghost Slap**, it has disadvantage on the next **saving throw against a Necromancy spell** cast before the end of your next turn.
-
**Frequently used in advanced social dominance training protocols and high-end recreational services.**

**Class:** Bard, Warlock, Wizard

### **Glassheart**

**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

As your attacker lands a devastating blow, your form momentarily fractures like glass. The critical hit is reduced to a normal hit, but you take an additional 1d4 psychic damage from the strain. At higher levels (5th, 11th, and 17th level), the psychic damage increases by 1d4.

**Class:** Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

### **Grasp of the Unseen**
*Cantrip Conjuration*

**Components:**   :: S
**Duration:**     :: 1 round

The hand disappears immediately after the effect occurs.

**Class:** Warlock, Wizard, Sorcerer

*Cantrip Transmutation*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: 15 feet
**Components:**   :: S, V
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You awaken the filth of the streets. Puddles ripple, dust rises, and refuse shifts unnaturally in a 15-foot cone originating from you. Creatures within range must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be briefly disoriented by the sudden movement, causing them to have disadvantage on the next opportunity attack they make before the end of their next turn. If cast in an area with significant debris or liquid, you can instead create a fleeting image or pattern in the grime, which lasts for 1 minute.

**Class:** Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock

### **Heartbreaker**
*9th-level necromancy (Unchanged name, eldritch-flavored: A whispered word that forces the heart to collapse in despair.)*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Permanent

You utter a phrase that **only the target can hear,** a word so dreadful their heart **shatters under the weight of it.**

- The target **must make a Constitution saving throw.** On a failure, they **suffer a heart attack and die.**
- On a success, they are left **paralyzed for 1d6+6 weeks, their body weak, their breath ragged.**
- Even those who survive **live with a permanent frailty (-1 Strength, -1 Constitution).**

Some say the phrase is not **a spell, but a name.** A name that, once spoken, can never be unheard.

**Class:** Bard, Warlock, Wizard

### **Heat Void**

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: Touch (1 forge, anvil, or crafting station)
\page
**Components:**   :: V, S, M (a coal that has never burned)
**Duration:**     :: 1 hour

You conjure a **forge heat that is not of this world**, replacing natural fire with **a silent, pulseless energy** that **reacts differently with metal, stone, and bone.**

- **Materials heated in the void fire behave unpredictably:**
- Metal **becomes malleable at touch**, allowing smiths to work **without heavy tools**—but it resists shaping if it "does not like" the intended form.
- Wood **does not burn**, but **warps as though alive**, resisting nails and glue.
- Bone **fuses with metal**, creating chimeric materials that may carry unknown properties.
- The heat **does not dissipate**—crafted items remain warm for **days after forging**, pulsing with unnatural warmth.

**Anomaly Effect:**
- If overused, the **forge itself begins to change**, its anvil and tools growing **veins of unknown black metal**, refusing to create mundane items.

**Class:** Artificer, Wizard

**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S

### **Hollow Gaze**
*Cantrip Necromancy*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: 15 feet
**Components:**   :: S, V
**Duration:**     :: 1 round

Your eyes darken as you channel a sliver of the void’s presence. One creature of your choice within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or feel an unnatural chill creeping over them. Until the start of your next turn, the creature has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks, and if it is concentrating on a spell, it must make a concentration check against your spell save DC.

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet

Your gaze locks onto a creature, **unnervingly hollow**, as though reality has forgotten how to render your features.

- The target makes a **Charisma saving throw**.
- On a failure, they experience a **momentary existential lapse**, losing 1d4 Intelligence (minimum 1) until the end of their next turn.
- If they **fail by 5 or more**, their **next spoken sentence is misheard by all creatures except the caster**, as if reality "mistranscribed" it.

**Anomaly Effect:**
- If the target **fails by 10 or more**, a **random piece of their personal history erases itself from reality**, leaving a **lingering feeling of unease** but no memory of what was lost.

**Class:** Bard, Warlock, Wizard

### **Hydrodynamic Lubrication Dispersal**
*3rd-level Transmutation*

- Examples include:
- "This door was never locked."
- "She was always employed here."
- "This bullet did not hit me."
- The effect **cannot be dispelled, countered, or challenged** by **ordinary magic**.
- A **court-level anomaly nullification hearing** (or a **5th-level dispel magic** cast in a place of corporate power) is required to break the clause.

**Components:**   :: V, S, M (a personal tracking beacon)

**Duration:**     :: 1 turn + 1 round/level

**Components:**   :: V, S, M (special tattoo ink worth 50gp)
**Duration:**     :: Permanent

**Range:**        :: 6 feet

**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S

### **Wisp of the Forgotten**
*Cantrip Necromancy*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: S, V
**Duration:**     :: 1 minute

You conjure a faint, ghostly whisper from beyond the veil, carrying an unintelligible but haunting message to a creature within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become unnerved until the start of its next turn, giving it disadvantage on the next Wisdom (Perception) check or initiative roll it makes. If the creature is already frightened, it takes psychic damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

**Class:** Bard, Warlock, Wizard

### **Witness of the Veil**
*5th-level divination*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, M (an unblinking glass eye)
**Duration:**     :: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You force a target to see **what should remain unseen**.

- The target must make a **Wisdom saving throw (DC 17)** or become **paranoid**, seeing shadowy figures lurking just beyond their vision.
- While paranoid, the target has **disadvantage on Perception checks** and must roll a **d6 at the start of each turn**:
- **1–3:** The hallucinations whisper terrible secrets, causing **2d8 psychic damage**.
- **4–6:** The target acts normally but remains unnerved.

The effect ends early if the target **passes three consecutive Wisdom saves** or if a **greater restoration** is cast.

**Class:** Cleric, Warlock, Wizard

### **Womb of the Unwritten**
*2nd-level Transmutation (Ritual)*

**Casting Time:** :: 10 minutes
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, M (a drop of void-infused ink, absorbed into the skin)
**Duration:**     :: Permanent (until the anomaly resolves itself)

You whisper **an incantation not meant for mortal tongues**, invoking the presence of something **that waits between fate and flesh**. The spell rewrites the **biological continuity of the target’s reproductive essence**, severing it from natural law and entangling it with the unknown.

- Upon casting, the target must roll a **d6**—their fate is dictated by an unseen force:
\page
- **1-2 | Fertility Erasure** – The target is **forgotten by the lineage of time**; they can no longer conceive, and **records of their ancestry begin to fade from existence**.
- **3-4 | Unstable Genesis** – The target’s fertility is **unpredictably altered**, capable of conception or sterility depending on **external anomalies**—moon phases, forgotten dreams, or the whispers of something in the walls.
- **5 | Fractured Inheritance** – Any offspring conceived by the target will inherit **memories, scars, or traits from an unknown progenitor**, one that never lived yet has always existed.
- **6 | The Unborn Take Root** – The target experiences a **phantasmal pregnancy**, feeling the weight of something growing within them—yet no child is ever born, only a presence that lingers in their shadow.

- The change is **not immediately noticed**—it takes effect **subtly, like a whisper embedded in the fabric of their being**.
- Any attempt to **reverse the effect** without understanding it risks **creating a secondary anomaly**, potentially rewriting the target’s **entire genetic structure**.

**Anomaly Effect:**
- If the spell is interrupted mid-cast, **all present individuals are momentarily connected by a shared bloodline**, as if they were part of an unseen genealogical tree that should not exist.

**Class:** Cleric, Wizard
