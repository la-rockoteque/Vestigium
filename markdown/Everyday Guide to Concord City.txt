# **Architect**
*Utility | Support | Terrain Control*  
> *“The city speaks. You just have to stand still long enough to listen.”
— Tala Viré, Concrete Harmonist*  

### Thematic Overview
Architects are spellcasters who manipulate the urban fabric itself. Their power is drawn from terrain: steel stairwells, concrete walls, neon signs, and forgotten alleys.
- They might be urban shamans, abandoned city- planners, or channelers of decaying infrastructure.
- Their power shifts with location, making them versatile but deeply territorial.
- Cantrips and spells change depending on the terrain they stand upon.
- Some believe the city is alive—and they are its voice.  

### Creating a Architect
- What part of the city speaks to you—its ruins, its spires, its neon heartbeat?
- Did you train in forgotten geometry, or did the city awaken something in you?
- What does your magic say about how you see Concord—decaying, alive, or divine?  

## Class Features
- **Hit Dice:** *D8 per Architect level*  
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** *8.0 + Constitution modifier*  
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** *D8 + Constitution modifier per level after 1st*

### Proficiencies
- **Armor:** *medium, light, shield*  
- **Weapons:** *Simple* 
- **Tools:** *Broadcast Kit, Survivalist Kit*  
- **Saving Throws:** *Wisdom, Constitution*  
- **Skills:** *Choose two from Athletics, Investigation, Nature, Perception, Stealth, Survival*

### Equipment

Body Harness (Leather)
Inaddition you choose from the following equipment:
A:
Dust Mask (Cloth)

## Class Abilities
 
### Spellcasting
Terrain- Locked Spellcasting

Architecture determines what you can cast.

- You know all Architect spells, but may only cast those associated with your current terrain.
- If you are not on terrain linked to any spells, you may not cast Architect spells (though you retain ritual casting and class features).
- Terrain Tags are assigned to each spell (e.g., “Rooftop,” “Alley,” “Subway,” etc.)


### Architectural Flow
You’ve learned to blend terrain into action.

- When you enter a new valid terrain, you may cast one cantrip associated with it as a free action (once per turn).
- Additionally, when you move into new terrain, you may spend a bonus action to:
- Change your attunement
- Gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier


### Stratum: Urban Philosophy
At 2nd level, choose your Architect Stratum — a layer of architectural philosophy embedded in your being.


### Environmental Catalyst
You’ve learned how to spark your magic into existence even in unlikely places.

- Once per short rest, you may treat an environment as another terrain type for 1 minute (e.g., treat a stairwell as a rooftop or an alley as a tunnel).
- Additionally, you may create a 10- ft radius false terrain aura once per day that counts as a valid terrain type for your spells (duration: 1 minute).


### Terrain Index
You keep a mental map of where your magic flows strongest.

- You may now maintain up to 2 terrain attunements at once.
- When casting a spell, you may choose which attunement to use.
- If you are within range of both terrains, you have advantage on spell attack rolls and impose disadvantage on saving throws against your Architect spells.


### Mnemonic Blueprint
You’ve imprinted structures into your memory.

- Once per long rest, you can memorize the terrain layout of a location (e.g., subway entrance, tower rooftop, collapsed building).
- You may invoke that terrain type for the purposes of spellcasting, even if you’re not physically present in it (lasts 10 minutes).


### Reconstructive Pulse
When the city breaks, you rebuild it.

- Once per long rest, you may cast Reconstructive Pulse, reshaping terrain in a 20- ft radius:
- Rubble becomes a wall, stairwells collapse or form anew, alleys close or open.
- You gain terrain control for 1 minute: all spells associated with the newly shaped terrain may be cast freely.
- Additionally, enemies in the zone must make a Dexterity save or be knocked prone or displaced.


### Urban Singularities
You are the design that undoes itself. You are the blueprint of the future.

- Once per long rest, you may invoke a Collapse or Renewal, permanently altering a terrain feature:
- Collapse: Destroy a terrain feature, causing a paranormal aftershock (choose: knockback, banishment, silence, or psychic surge).
- Renewal: Restore or fabricate a new terrain feature (e.g., rebuild a bridge, create a rooftop from broken rubble), allowing immediate spellcasting as if you were there.
- After using this, for 1 hour, you may cast Architect spells regardless of terrain.

### Stratum of Concrete
> The world is steel and stone. And I am its guardian.  

You draw strength from reinforced structures, foundations, and the enduring weight of concrete. Your power stabilizes and protects, rooted in solidity.

#### Roleplay & Playstyle
You are immovable in defense and infrastructure. You thrive in zones with solid, defined terrain like rooftops and bunkers. Expect buffs, barriers, and protection- based spells.  

#### Subclass Abilities
|Level|Feature|
|:-:|:--:|
  |3|Urban Reinforcement|
|6|Foundation Lock|
|10|Bastion of the Old City|
|14|Living Stronghold|
---

#### Features

### Urban Reinforcement
You can reshape stone and metal terrain into shields and cover. When standing on concrete, rebar, steel, or solid buildings, you gain +1 AC.

You also gain the **Fortify Cantrip**, which grants temporary HP to you or an ally if cast while on reinforced surfaces.



### Foundation Lock
You can root yourself in solid ground. As a reaction when you're pushed, pulled, or knocked prone while standing on concrete or steel, you can cancel the movement and reduce the triggering damage by your Wisdom modifier.



### Bastion of the Old City
Your defensive spells now protect structures and nearby terrain. Creatures affected by your protective spells gain +1 AC and resistance to force damage when within 5 feet of concrete or stone.

You may cast *Wall of Stone* once per long rest without expending a spell slot.



### Living Stronghold
You are treated as half cover for allies adjacent to you when standing on urban terrain. When you cast a spell while touching stone, rebar, or steel, you gain temporary HP equal to your Wisdom modifier + Architect level.

\page
--- 

### Stratum of Neon
> The lights never go out, and neither do I.  

You pulse with the rhythm of electricity and late- night city life. Your magic is as artificial as it is alive, crackling through neon veins.

#### Roleplay & Playstyle
Fast- paced, reactive, and chaotic. You manipulate lights, visual illusions, and raw electrical surges. Best in urban environments with power lines, signs, or exposed tech.  

#### Subclass Abilities
|Level|Feature|
|:-:|:--:|
  |3|Neon Veil|
|6|Signal Echo|
|10|Lightshift Reflex|
|14|Neon Ascendant|
---

#### Features

### Neon Veil
While in brightly lit environments (neon signs, electronic ads, glowing graffiti), you can blur your outline. You gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can use a bonus action to impose disadvantage on one attack against you.

You also gain the **Glitch Bolt Cantrip**, which deals lightning or psychic damage and causes flickering hallucinations on a failed save.



### Signal Echo
Once per short rest, when you cast a spell, you can delay its effect by 1 round. A shimmering echo of the spell surges into place, activating on your next turn without using a slot.



### Lightshift Reflex
When you would be targeted by an attack while standing in artificial light, you can teleport 10 feet as a reaction. You must end in an area of similar lighting.



### Neon Ascendant
You become immune to being blinded and can see through bright light or artificial dazzle as if it were dim light. Once per long rest, you can cast *Synaptic Static* without using a spell slot, but only while in a brightly lit, urban environment.

\page
--- 

### Stratum of Rust
> Metal rots like flesh. The city was never built to last.  

You channel decay as a form of artistry. Where others see ruin, you see release—your magic wears things down to their truth.

#### Roleplay & Playstyle
Debuff and decay specialist. Use corroded, rusted terrain to wear down armor, weaken structures, and debilitate enemies over time.  

#### Subclass Abilities
|Level|Feature|
|:-:|:--:|
  |3|Corrosive Insight|
|6|Entropy Pulse|
|10|Collapse Architect|
|14|Architect of Ruin|
---

#### Features

### Corrosive Insight
When you target a creature with a spell while standing in a rusted or decaying area, you can corrode their defenses. They have disadvantage on their next saving throw against a spell that deals damage.

You also gain the **Rustbite Cantrip**, which deals acid damage and has a chance to reduce armor AC temporarily.



### Entropy Pulse
As a bonus action, you can release a wave of destabilizing decay around you. All creatures of your choice within 10 feet take acid damage equal to your Wisdom modifier and must succeed on a Constitution save or have their AC reduced by 1 for 1 minute (once per long rest).



### Collapse Architect
When casting a spell that affects structures or terrain, you can choose to collapse weakened areas. Difficult terrain created this way becomes dangerous terrain — causing damage to creatures who move through it.

Spells that reshape or destroy terrain (like *Mold Urban Earth*) affect twice the normal area.




### Architect of Ruin
You gain resistance to acid and psychic damage. Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 HP in a rusted or crumbling area, you can cause a chain reaction — dealing damage equal to your Architect level to another target within 10 feet.

### Operative Subtype

### Handler Protocol
“You’re never truly alone in the field.”

Upon choosing your subclass, you are assigned a Handler — a remote operative who provides intelligence, coordinates missions, and ensures your loyalty.
- You gain access to a secure communication line to your handler. You can contact them once per long rest to request one of the following:
- Information Request: Ask a question about a person, location, faction, or object. The handler provides the most accurate intel available.
- Resource Ping: Gain advantage on one Investigation or Insight check as your handler supplies contextual data.
- Fallback Orders: Your handler directs you to a temporary safehouse, dead drop, or support contact within the current district.
- You must contact your handler at least once per in- world week. Failure to check in results in your status being marked as “Unverified.”

- Lose access to subclass features.

- Alternatively, you can use this to erase a digital record or physical clue instantly.


### Blacklisted Presence

- On success, your version becomes true for all narrative and mechanical purposes.

### Operative of Serevan 
> The revolution is subtle, calculated—and already inside the building.  

Trained under collective doctrine, you work best as a ghost in the machine—undermining from within.

#### Roleplay & Playstyle
You thrive in collaborative sabotage. Use tech disruption, misinformation, and debuffs to tilt the battlefield. You’re the eye in the crowd, the whisper in the comms, guiding allies through chaos while never being the center of attention.

### Tactician of Vexholm
> Precision, pressure, and patience: that's how cities fall.  

You were bred for victory by attrition—trained in battlefield infiltration, sabotage, and asymmetric warfare.

### Unaffiliated
> No allies. No backup. Just you and the silence.  

Once part of a larger intelligence network, you’ve been cast out — or walked away. You now operate with no backup, no handler, and no support. But with that isolation comes freedom… and danger.

#### Roleplay & Playstyle
You’ve burned bridges—by choice or betrayal. You now operate with complete freedom, but no support network. You rely on improvisation, paranoia, and brute cunning. Every move matters because no one is coming to save you.

---

#### Features

### Burned Identity
You lose access to your Handler and any subclass features granted at 3rd level. However, you gain the following:
- Ghost Protocol: You can assume a false identity with minimal preparation. After 1 hour of downtime, you may establish a new alias with a name, background, and credentials. You gain advantage on checks made to pass as this identity until someone actively attempts to investigate you.
- Improvised Network: Once per long rest, you can call in a favor from a local contact — someone you once helped, bribed, or saved. Roll a d100. On a 50+, they provide helpful intel, a safehouse, or an item worth up to 50 gp. On a failure, no one answers — or worse, someone else does.3



### Quiet Resolve
- You gain proficiency in Constitution saving throws if you don’t already have it.
- While operating alone (no allies within 30 feet), you may reroll one failed ability check or saving throw per long rest.
- Your movements leave no trace — you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, and magical tracking requires a successful Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC.



### Deep Silence
You’ve learned how to disappear even under pressure.
- You may cast nondetection on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.
- If you are reduced to 0 HP and not outright killed, you may instead drop to 1 HP and immediately become invisible until the end of your next turn. You can use this ability once per long rest.



### Nobody
Your past is smoke. Your trail is ash.
- Your name, biometrics, and records are erased from every official system, magical or otherwise. Any magical effect attempting to divine your identity, history, or fate automatically fails unless the caster succeeds on a DC 20 Arcana check.
- Once per long rest, you may declare a “No- Name Strike”: You automatically critically hit with a melee or ranged weapon attack made from stealth or against a surprised target.

## Subclasses: Creed of the Cultist

### The Burning Creed
> Truth is a flicker. Silence is sanctuary.  

You worship oblivion, not as destruction, but as transcendence. Silence is sacred. Fear is a tool. You erase, suppress, and unmake—until only the unknown remains.

#### Roleplay & Playstyle
- You favor manipulation through suppression—silencing minds, erasing memories, and darkening light.
- Infiltration and fear are your weapons. You thrive in moments of uncertainty and emotional voids.
- Often the most unsettling voice at the table—speaking softly, or not at all.

Once per long rest.

### The Consuming Creed
> Become whoever they need—then make them regret it.  

You worship masks—fluid identity, fabricated charisma, and the performance of belief. You follow shape- shifting messiahs, wear borrowed faces, and thrive in the fiction between lies.

#### Roleplay & Playstyle
- You are a manipulator and social infiltrator, using charm and false celebritys to disarm others.
- Disguise, deception, and seduction are part of your spiritual toolkit.
- You blur lines between truth and belief—sometimes even to yourself.

- Lasts 1 minute, or until you are incapacitated.

Once per long rest.

### The Hollow Creed
> Your sanity is a cocoon. Break it.  

Madness is not a flaw—it is initiation. You seek visions in agony, truth in delusion, and communion through pain. You burn away sanity to see what lies behind the veil.

#### Roleplay & Playstyle
- You play erratic, obsessive, and inspired. The line between prophet and lunatic is always shifting.
- Your powers are erratic but potent—hallucinations, compulsions, emotional extremes.
- You welcome instability as a gift, not a curse.

### The Masked Creed
> What writhes beneath your skin deserves worship too.

#### Roleplay & Playstyle
- You rely on summoning, corruption, and bodily transformation.
- You’re symbiotic with your anomaly—serving it while it changes you.

## Class Abilities
 
### Mechanized Bond
**Mechanized Bond.** 
At 1st level, you form a deep, nearly symbiotic bond with a derelict mech chassis salvaged from the industrial ruins of Concord City. This bond transforms the forgotten machine into an extension of your own body—enhancing your defenses, weaponry, and mobility when you enter mech mode.

## Benefits While in Mech Mode

- **Enhanced Armor:** 
 While piloting your mech, your Armor Class becomes 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus as the mech’s sturdy frame absorbs blows that would otherwise harm you.

- **Integrated Weaponry:** 
 Your mech is outfitted with basic energy and melee weapons. You may use its attack options in place of your celebrityl attacks. The mech’s damage die is determined by your level (see *Psyblade Damage Die Progression* table for similar scaling), and you can use your mech’s attacks to deliver additional effects granted by your class features.

- **Augmented Mobility:** 
 The mech’s boosters grant you superior movement in urban combat. You gain advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks to climb, and your jump distance increases by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus.

- **Interface Protocols:** 
 Your bond with the mech unlocks a series of specialized maneuvers:
 
- **Overdrive (Level 5 feature):** 
 Once per short rest, you can enter overdrive mode. For 1 minute, your mech’s attacks deal an extra 1d6 damage and you move an additional 10 feet on your turn.
 
- **Coolant Flush (Level 7 feature):** 
 As a bonus action, you can expel the mech’s built‑up heat to dispel one condition affecting either you or the mech. This can be done once per long rest.
 
- **Lockstep Anchor (Level 10 feature):** 
 When making a melee attack in mech mode, you can anchor the mech to its target, giving you advantage on saving throws against effects that would knock you prone or move you against your will until the start of your next turn.




### Frame Protocols
You install a system of tactical subroutines into your mech. Choose two Frame Protocols at 2nd level. You gain additional ones at levels 6, 10, 14, and 18. Examples include:

- **Target Lock:** Gain +1 to attack rolls against a chosen target for 1 minute.
- **Adaptive Shelling:** Temporarily gain resistance to a chosen damage type for 1 round.
- **Stabilizer Jets:** Ignore difficult terrain when dashing.


### Chassis Specialization
You specialize your mech for a specific purpose. Choose one chassis:
Each chassis grants unique features at levels 3, 7, 11, and 15.



### Overdrive Surge
Once per short rest, you can push your mech beyond normal limits. For 1 minute:
- You gain one extra attack per Attack action.
- Your movement speed increases by 10 feet.
- You deal +1d6 extra damage on melee or ranged mech attacks.


### Frame Protocol Upgrade
Gain one additional Frame Protocol and you may use two protocols simultaneously.


### Ghost Sync
Your bond becomes nearly invisible to sensors:
- While in mech mode, you are considered lightly obscured to digital detection.
- You may roll a Dexterity (Stealth) check to become "digitally hidden."


### Anchor Drive
Gain access to Lockstep Anchor (see Mechanized Bond). In addition:
- You become immune to forced movement while mech mode is active.


### Chassis Feature
Gain your chassis' unique 11th- level upgrade.


### Emergency Ejection
Once per long rest, if reduced to 0 HP, you can eject from your mech and stabilize at 1 HP instead of falling unconscious. Your mech remains inert and may be re- entered after a short rest.


### Frame Protocol Upgrade
You gain a third simultaneous protocol slot and an additional Frame Protocol choice.


### Chassis Feature
Gain your chassis' unique 15th- level upgrade.


### Tactical Reboot
Once per long rest, you can reset all Frame Protocol cooldowns and Overdrive Surge. You may also reboot one destroyed mech part, such as a broken limb or weapon system.



### Framewalker Apex
You can now maintain mech mode indefinitely. Additionally, you are no longer considered a separate creature from your mech for the purpose of spells and effects; if one is healed, the other benefits as well.


### Ascended Pilot
You and your mech become a symbol of resistance or fear in Concord City:
- Choose one:
- **Citybreaker:** Once per long rest, unleash a devastating strike that affects all targets in a 60- foot radius. Targets must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 8d10 force damage and be knocked prone.
- **Omni- Sync:** For 1 minute, all Frame Protocols activate simultaneously without requiring actions or bonus actions. You gain an extra reaction per round.

You also regain 1 use of Overdrive Surge on initiative roll.

### Momentum Shield
- While moving 10 ft or more in a turn, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier at the end of that movement.

### Perfect Intercept
- Once per long rest, when a creature moves within 30 ft of you, you may move up to your speed and make an attack against it before it completes its movement.
- If the attack hits, its speed drops to 0, and it cannot move further this turn.

### Wraith
> The city doesn’t see you. It feels you… too late.  

Masters of stealth technology and phased movement, Wraiths are Framewalkers who move through walls, shadows, and doubt.

#### Roleplay & Playstyle
You’re a phantom in armor—deadly but unseen.
- Play this subclass if you enjoy stealth tactics and surgical strikes.
- You specialize in infiltration, sabotage, and hit- and- run strategies.

#### Features

### Phase Flicker
- You may Dash as a bonus action.
- Once per short rest, you may move through solid obstacles or enemies for 10 feet. If you end in an occupied space, you’re shunted to the nearest unoccupied one and the creature takes 1d6 force damage.



### Spectral Momentum
- While Framed, if you move at least 10 feet and do not attack, you become lightly obscured until your next turn.
- You can now use the Disengage action as a bonus action when in Frame mode.



### Afterimage Cut
- Once per turn, when you attack, you can leave behind a flickering afterimage.
- A creature who targets you with an attack must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + proficiency + Dex mod). On a failure, they hit the afterimage instead and the attack misses.



### Null Step
- Once per long rest, you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Until the end of your next turn:
- You are invisible.
- Your attacks deal +2d6 force damage.
- You can pass through creatures and objects as if incorporeal (up to 10 ft at a time).

- Remotely access any electronic or magical device within 60 ft
- Intercept digital transmissions (including some spell- like effects)
- Communicate with digital anomalies and AI spirits


### Patchcasting
Instead of traditional spells, you run patches — semi- sentient routines written in esoteric code. You maintain a Deck of Patchcards, each with analog interfaces (tapes, discs, printed punchcards).

- Override (Control a device or machine)
- Blackout (Shut down lights or visuals)
- Scramble Signature (Disguise or cloak yourself)

### Subnet Specialization (Subclass)
Choose you specialization

- You always know its location
- You can trigger malfunctions, deal psychic damage, or drain its abilities

- Appear anywhere within 60 ft (as long as a digital signal or wired connection reaches it)


### Root Access
You gain master- level control over one type of device or entity (pick 1 per long rest: cameras, radios, drones, AI, containment wards, etc.). You can:
- Reprogram it instantly
- Control all similar devices in a 300- ft radius
- Implant a temporary directive or viral message


### Ascend the Stack
Once per long rest, merge with the Grid for 1 minute:
- You become intangible, except through screens and machines

# **Judge**
*Support | Tank*  
> *“The city is rot and rust. But I am the gavel.”
— Magister Enactum, Fifth Accord*  

### Thematic Overview
Judges are Concord’s remaining law—zealots with vows bound to blood, secrecy, profit, or the dust of the poor. Through consecration or desecration, they reshape zones into places of authority or judgment.
- They serve monarchs, corporations, secret orders—or break their vows and go rogue.
- Their powers sanctify ground, deny spellcasting, and reinforce law- by- force.
- Some are feared like inquisitors. Others walk among the slums as grim protectors.
- Their word is not law. Their presence is.  

### Creating a Judge
- Who gave you your vow—royalty, a corporate board, a secret doctrine, or desperation?
- What do you consecrate, and what do you desecrate?
- If your vow is broken, who—or what—will come for you?  

## Class Features
- **Hit Dice:** *D8 per Judge level*  
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** *8.0 + Constitution modifier*  
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** *D8 + Constitution modifier per level after 1st*

## Class Abilities
 
### Spellcasting
You know all the spells from the enforcer spell list


### Consecrate/Desecrate
You can create a Consecrated or Desecrated Zone as a bonus action, once per long rest at level 2, twice at level 5, and scaling up.
- Lasts 1 minute, unless dismissed early.
- Radius begins at 10 feet and scales to 30–60 feet at higher levels.
- You can choose Consecrate or Desecrate when creating the zone:
- Consecrate: benefits allies, weakens undead, improves healing, buffs divine/holy spells.
- Desecrate: empowers necrotic or dark energy, weakens divine effects, buffs fear/control spells.


### Spellcasting in a Zone
You gain one of the following effects when casting spells while standing in your own zone:
- +1 to spell attack rolls (or spell save DC)
- +1 spell level for damage/healing scaling (1/rest)
- Immunity to concentration disruption on saving throws
- Bonus effects tied to spell school (e.g., Evocation gains extra 5 ft radius)

At level 13+, allies also benefit from your zone effects if they cast while within it.


### Spellcasting Restriction
You can only cast a spell when on a consecrated/desecrated zone


### Zone of Authority
You gain the Consecrate/Desecrate feature as detailed previously. You can use it a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses on a long rest.

Additionally, you gain proficiency in:
- Medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons
- Wisdom saving throws
- Two skills from: Insight, Athletics, Intimidation, Investigation, Survival


### Rites of Enforcement
You learn how to inscribe Rites into your Consecrated or Desecrated zones. Choose one Rite from the list below. You gain an additional Rite at levels 6, 10, and 14.
- Rite of Binding: Enemies in your zone cannot take the Dash or Disengage actions.
- Rite of Denial: Creatures in the zone cannot be invisible, and illusions are automatically revealed to you.
- Rite of Grief: Enemies who fail a save in your zone take 1d4 psychic damage (once per turn).
- Rite of Command: You may issue a simple order (“flee,” “drop it,” “kneel”) once per round as a reaction; targets must succeed a Wisdom save or obey for 1 turn.
- Rite of Collapse (Desecrate only): Structures in the zone become brittle. You can destroy a wall, support beam, or similar object as a bonus action.


### Enforcement Domain
Choose a subclass:
- The Magistrate (Lawful Authority)
- The Warden (Containment Specialist)

(We can design these next.)


### Empowered Zone
At higher levels, you can spend a spell slot to Empower your zone:

- Increase duration to 10 minutes
- Turn spell effects cast in zone into magical difficult terrain, aura suppression, or radiating fear


### Hardened Zone
- While in your active Consecrate or Desecrate zone:

- Creatures cannot teleport into or out of the zone without succeeding on a Charisma saving throw (DC = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + Wisdom mod).


### Ritual Seizure

- Choose two creatures in the zone. They must make a Wisdom saving throw or suffer one of the following:
- Consecrate: Become Frightened until the end of your next turn.
- Desecrate: Take 2d10 psychic damage and cannot benefit from cover until end of next turn.
- Use this once per activation.


### Layered Enforcement
- You can maintain two active zones simultaneously, but only one may be Consecrate and the other Desecrate.
- You may place the second zone up to 30 feet away when activated.
- Switching both zones costs a single bonus action.


### Sealed Judgment
- You can invoke a paranormal decree that affects a creature in your zone. Once per long rest, choose one:
- Vow of Silence: The target cannot speak, cast verbal spells, or communicate for 1 minute (Wis save ends early).
- Anchored Soul: The target cannot teleport, phase, or enter ethereal space for 1 minute.
- Null Mandate: Target becomes unable to benefit from magical effects for 1 round (functions like antimagic field only on them).


### Command Presence
- While you are in your active zone, creatures of your choice that start their turn within it must succeed a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed or frightened (your choice) until the start of their next turn.
- This effect does not require concentration.


### Dominion Threshold
- You can now use your Consecrate/Desecrate ability an unlimited number of times.
- Your zone radius increases to 30 feet.
- Once per long rest, when you switch between Consecrate and Desecrate, you may unleash a Reality Seal:

## Subclasses: Vow of the Judge
nan


### The Broken Vow
> They cast you out. You became something worse.  

This subclass activates when a Judge renounces their Vow voluntarily, is excommunicated by the faction they swore to, or breaks their Vow’s tenets during a major story event.

#### Roleplay & Playstyle
You’ve broken with your faction. Now your power comes from raw conviction and residual echoes of authority. You’re disruptive, unaligned, and intimidating—a rogue verdict walking. Ideal for morally complex stories.  

#### Subclass Abilities
|Level|Feature|
|:-:|:--:|
  |3|Collapse Doctrine|
|3|Severed Presence|
|6|Null Directive|
|10|Fractured Identity|
---

#### Features

### Collapse Doctrine
You are the doctrine of decay. Your zone becomes a site of collapse, regardless of faction or faith.
- When you use Desecrate, all enemies in the zone must make a Wisdom saving throw or suffer one of the following effects (your choice):
1.Disarmament – They drop one held item.
2.Isolation – They cannot be targeted by or benefit from allies’ spells or features for 1 round.
3.Falter – Their movement is halved, and they cannot take reactions until the end of their next turn.
- Once per long rest, you may expand your zone to 60 feet for 1 minute, during which time it is considered both Consecrate and Desecrate, and you may apply both effects simultaneously.



### Severed Presence
Your Consecrate/Desecrate zones still function, but they now reflect void authority:
- Consecrate: Becomes a Zone of Suppression. All magical healing and buffs within are halved. Creatures cannot gain temporary hit points.
- Desecrate: Becomes a Zone of Collapse. At the start of each of your turns, choose one creature in the zone. They must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be silenced (unable to cast spells with verbal components or speak) until the start of your next turn.

You no longer benefit from your former Vow’s passive or Channel ability.



### Null Directive
You’ve become a disruptive force to both arcane and ideological systems.
- When a creature casts a spell within 10 feet of you, you may use your reaction to attempt to nullify it. The caster must make a spellcasting ability check vs. your Save DC. On a failure, the spell fizzles but is still expended.
- You cannot be the target of divination or faction- based effects, including Blessing of the Royals, corporate buffs, or effects that rely on trust/allegiance.



### Fractured Identity
Your lack of allegiance manifests as paranormal fracturing.
- Once per short rest, you may split yourself. As a bonus action, you create a ghostly afterimage in your zone. Until the end of your next turn:
- You may treat the afterimage as the source of your spells, attacks, and reactions.
- Creatures have disadvantage to track or predict you (Insight and attacks).
- Additionally, enemies inside your zone cannot benefit from Help actions or leadership auras — their unity breaks down in your presence.

\page

### Vow of Bloodline
> Blood remembers. And so do I.  

Only the worthy may rule. Bloodlines are not just heritage, they are design.

#### Roleplay & Playstyle
You represent elite authority and hereditary dominance. You protect royalty, enforce titles, and punish the unworthy. Play this subclass if you enjoy hierarchy, court drama, or noble power fantasy twisted by paranormal law.  

#### Subclass Abilities

Once per long rest, speak a name aloud as an action. That creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.
- Creatures without recognized titles or noble lineage roll at disadvantage.
- You always know the true nobility status of creatures within 30 feet.

Zone Effects:
- Consecrate: Allies of noble blood or bearing an official insignia gain +1 AC.
- Desecrate: Enemies without noble status have disadvantage on Charisma checks and saves.



### Court of Authority
While in Consecrate, you radiate regal presence:
- Allies within the zone gain advantage on saves against charm/fear.
- You may use Command once per turn (no spell slot) on creatures of lesser social standing.



### Unassailable Lineage
You become immune to effects that alter your appearance, memories, or allegiance.
- While in Consecrate, allies are immune to disguise or charm effects from enemies with no title or rank.

- That creature cannot benefit from inspiration, bardic dice, or aid.
- If they die in your zone, they cannot be resurrected without a wish.

### Vow of Dust
> The forgotten still have fists.  

They buried us beneath the city. We learned to rise through the cracks.

#### Roleplay & Playstyle

#### Features

### Uprising Echo
Once per long rest, invoke the memory of a past revolt. All creatures in the zone must succeed on a Constitution save or be restrained by rubble, wire, or vision until the end of your next turn.
- Your zone radius increases by 10 feet when in slums, ruins, or sewer districts.
- You can sense the presence of buried bodies, structural weaknesses, or hidden graffiti.

Zone Effects:
- Consecrate: Allies with no faction, wealth, or home gain advantage on saves vs. control/charm.
- Desecrate: Enemies with known affiliations or luxurious items suffer- 1 to all saving throws.



### Dustborn Stamina
You and your allies regain 1d4+proficiency temporary hit points at the start of your turn while in Consecrate.
- You ignore difficult terrain in collapsed, forgotten, or polluted environments.



### Ragged Reprisal
Once per short rest, when you’re reduced to half HP or less, you may immediately activate Desecrate (no action).
- Until end of your next turn, attacks made by you or allies against enemies in the zone crit on a 19–20.



### The City Remembers
You can commune with the scars of the city. Once per day, while in Consecrate:
- You can ask the zone one question.
- The answer is given via paranormal signs, faint voices, or physical shifts.
- Treat as Commune, but flavored through ghost- rubble and forgotten memories.

### Vow of Profit
> Justice has a price. Pay up.  

All things have value. Even justice has a price.

#### Roleplay & Playstyle
You work for the corporates—or at least their paychecks. You monetize pain, enforce contracts, and tax healing itself. A great subclass for players who want to explore capitalist horror or bureaucratic violence as a playstyle.

Zone Effects:
- Consecrate: When any creature gains HP or gold, you gain 1d4 temp HP.
- Desecrate: All healing within the zone is halved (no save).



### Contract Clause: Nullify
You can cast Counterspell or Dispel Magic once per long rest as a “contractual void clause”.
- If the target is a summoned, hired, or bound creature, it rolls at disadvantage against the effect.



### Collateral Audit
Once per long rest, you can force an enemy to declare what they value most (via supernatural insight).
- Choose one item/relationship/status. If the creature enters your Desecrate zone, they must make a Charisma save or take psychic damage equal to your level as you target their value.



### The Balance Must Settle
If a creature within your zone reduces another to 0 HP, you may immediately charge them interest:
- They take 2d12 force damage unless they succeed on a Wisdom saving throw.
- You regain HP equal to the damage dealt.

# **Medic**
*Healer | Support*

### Thematic Overview
Medics are battlefield specialists who stabilize allies, distribute black- market stims, and keep squads alive against all odds.

## Class Abilities
 
### Stabilization Protocol
You can stabilize any creature at 0 HP as a bonus action using your kit. If you roll high enough (Medicine check or custom roll), they regain 1 HP instead of staying unconscious.


### Trauma Charges
You gain Trauma Charges, limited- use actions fueled by your medical adrenaline and supernatural grit. You regain them on a short rest. You can spend one to:
- Auto- succeed a medicine check
- Allow an ally to take an action immediately (adrenaline injection)
- Cleanse a condition (poisoned, paralyzed, charmed)
- Intercept fatal damage, taking it instead


### Trauma Response
Starting at level two, you can expand medical equipement to achieve the same result as a spell. When you expand a spell slot, you must also pay the cost with medical equipement worth 100 fold the spell slot.


### Medical Division (Subclass)
Choose your method of healing:


### Hemostatic Ritual
Once per long rest, you may create a Stabilization Field — a 10- ft radius where bleeding stops, HP can’t fall below 1, and healing spells restore max possible value.


### Clinical Butchery
- Melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on 19–20 against bleeding or poisoned targets.
- If you kill a creature with a critical hit, you may immediately regain 1 use of your Harvest Token feature.


### Override Directive
When a creature dies within 60 ft, you may spend a Trauma Charge to intercept their death. If used:
- Their soul is suspended
- You must reach them and begin Emergency Resuscitation Ritual (takes 1 min, auto- success with help)
- If successful, the creature returns to life with 1 HP and a permanent scar or anomaly


### Black Market Stash
- You’ve stashed a series of body- part- based tools. Once per long rest, you may consume a Harvest Token to:
- Cast Enhance Ability, Remove Curse, or Lesser Restoration without components or spellcasting.


### Soul Triage
You may diagnose supernatural trauma. Once per rest, touch a creature and ask:
- What curse or anomaly affects them?
- What was their most recent trauma?
- What hidden wound or burden are they carrying?

You also gain resistance to psychic damage and possession.


### Harvest Masterpiece
- When you expend 3 Harvest Tokens at once, you may perform a Master Extraction:
- Heal a creature to full HP,
- Or craft a temporary anomaly, such as:
- A second set of lungs for underwater breathing,
- Hardened bone plating (AC +2),
- Enhanced eyes (see invisible/advantage on Perception).

The enhancement lasts 1 hour before decaying.


### Red Tag Protocol
Once per long rest, declare a subject dead — even if they’re still alive. That creature:
- Cannot be targeted by any effect or spell unless you allow it
- Is invisible to most scrying, detection, or anomalies
- May “revive” from a critical blow with full HP once before the end of combat


### Emergency Containment Field
Once per long rest, deploy your ultimate trauma ward:
- All creatures within 30 ft are immediately stabilized
- All conditions are removed (except death or transformation)
- Anomalies attempting to breach the field must succeed on a high DC save or be suppressed
- Lasts 1 minute; during this time, you may cast any healing or cleansing spell at max effect once per turn

### Longshot Doctrine
- You ignore disadvantage for attacking at long range.
- When you Ready an action to attack and do so before your next turn, add your proficiency bonus to the damage roll.

## Class Abilities
 
### Momentum
Your movement builds up kinetic energy. Every 10 feet you move on your turn grants a Momentum Die (d4), to a max of 3. You can spend these dice:
- To add to damage (melee or thrown)
- To boost an Acrobatics, Stealth, or Initiative roll
- To reduce falling damage

- Can ignore difficult terrain
- Immune to attacks of opportunity for the turn


### Rift Art (Subclass)
Choose your method of transcending physicality:


### Vaultbreaker
You may use a bonus action to leap 20 feet without provoking attacks. If you land adjacent to a creature, you may shove or disarm them as part of the move.


### Chrono Reflex
Once per short rest, when a creature misses you, you may rewind to the position you were in at the beginning of your last turn and repeat your turn from that spot, with new decisions.


### Wall of Air
While in Flowstate, your movement displaces enough paranormal static to create an aura of distortion:
- Ranged attacks suffer disadvantage
- Creatures within 5 feet of you have a 20% chance to miss entirely as your afterimages flicker


### Flicker Clash
You may take 2 turns in a row once per long rest. Between them, you temporarily vanish into a “skip” — a fractured echo of your future self. You appear in two places at once for the duration, leaving a copy that distracts or deals psychic damage.


### Step Outside Time
Once per long rest, you fully leave normal space for 6 seconds. During this turn:
- You may move up to 300 ft
- You take no attacks, ignore all terrain, and walk through walls
- Afterward, choose one:

- Swap places with an ally
- Appear beside a target and land a critical hit with advantage

You also gain proficiency in Land Vehicles or Air Vehicles (your choice).



### Bypass Grid
You can move through enemy- occupied spaces without provoking opportunity attacks. You can also Dash as a bonus action if you’re carrying your designated package.



### Emergency Drop
As a reaction when you’re hit by an attack, you can drop your package to reduce the damage by half and teleport it to an allied creature within 60 feet who can see you.
If the object is a creature, it lands safely and prone instead.



### No Fail Delivery
Once per long rest, you can choose to automatically succeed on any check, save, or attack roll related to transporting your package (includes carrying, defending, or delivering it).
Additionally, nothing short of magical paralysis can prevent you from moving on your turn.

### Flicker Step
As a bonus action, you can teleport up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.
You can also Dash through transparent barriers (glass, forcefields, etc.) without breaking them.



### Rift Wake
Whenever you teleport, the space you left behind shudders. All creatures adjacent to your origin space must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + Dexterity modifier) or take 1d6 force damage and be pushed 5 feet.



### Phasic Disruption
Your movements distort local spacetime. When you move more than 30 feet on your turn, you become blurred until the start of your next turn.
Attacks against you have disadvantage unless the attacker can see through illusions or distortions.



### Break the Frame
Once per long rest, you can phase completely out of the visible plane for up to 1 minute. While in this state:
- You are invisible, incorporeal, and immune to nonmagical damage.
- You can move through walls and floors.
- You cannot interact with the world physically, but you can still observe and hear normally.

You may end this state early as a bonus action.

#### Features

### Urban Acrobatics
You gain a climb speed equal to your movement speed, and you can move across vertical surfaces and ceilings without falling during the move.
Additionally, when you Dash, you ignore difficult terrain caused by debris, rubble, or urban clutter.



### Momentum Redirection
When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to move 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. If you end this movement adjacent to the attacker, your next melee attack against them has advantage.



### Fluid Vault
Your movement becomes so honed that you can take two Dash actions on your turn instead of one.
Also, when you would fall, you can make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to instead bounce off a surface and land safely on your feet.



### Echo Step
You briefly leave behind a kinetic echo. Once per short rest, when you use your Dash action, you may leave behind a static image of yourself in your previous location. Until the start of your next turn, attacks against you are made with disadvantage.

Unbound Horror (Source Feature)

“You were the lock. Now the door swings open.”

If you die and are not revived within 1 minute, the Entity bound to your Mutation Core or psyche is unleashed.

- It remembers the party.
- It acts with knowledge of your Scourge abilities.
- It blames the players for your death — even if that isn’t true.

This creature is:
- Hostile to the party and possibly reality itself.
- Treated as a paranormal anomaly, which can only be permanently destroyed through containment, banishment, or unraveling its core (GM’s discretion).
- Immune to charm, control, or banishment effects from the party for 24 hours after its release.

“The moment you die, they hear it breathing through the walls.”

4.You leave scorched footsteps.
5.You don’t appear in video recordings.

This includes stats, voice, and behavior. Your HP and gear remain unchanged. Once used, this can’t be used again until you finish a long rest.

### The Blooming Fester
> Wherever you bleed, life finds a way to rot.  

A fungal anomaly lives in your blood. You heal through decomposition, fight with spores, and thrive in decay.

#### Roleplay & Playstyle
- Gross, regenerative, and hard to kill.
- Great area denial and healing options through terrain corruption.
- Builds around Constitution and Constitution- based saving throws.

---

#### Features

### Spore Husk
You gain resistance to poison and necrotic damage. When a creature within 5 feet of you dies, it erupts in spore- laced mist. Each creature in the area must succeed on a CON saving throw (DC = 8 + your CON mod + proficiency bonus) or be poisoned until the end of their next turn.



### Bloom from Death
When you reduce a creature to 0 HP, you can cause a fungal blossom to sprout from their corpse. As a bonus action on your turns, you can command all such blossoms (up to CON mod) to emit bursts: enemies within 5 feet take 1d8 poison damage (CON save halves). Blossoms last 1 minute.



### Mycelial Armor
You are permanently surrounded by a thin layer of fungal growth. You gain +1 AC, and enemies that hit you with melee attacks take poison damage equal to your proficiency bonus.



### Fungal Rebirth
Once per long rest, if you are reduced to 0 HP but not killed outright, your body bursts into spores and regrows. You return to life at half HP at the start of your next turn. Enemies within 10 feet take 2d8 poison damage and must succeed on a CON save or be blinded until end of their next turn.

### The King Beyond
> Your chains are your crown.  

A royal entity of judgment and control lives inside you. Chains burst from your body to bind, subdue, and rule others.

#### Roleplay & Playstyle
- Ideal for battlefield control and roleplay of fallen monarchs.
- Build for Wisdom, Charisma, and control tactics.
- Embrace the vibe of guilt, penance, or power unearned.
- Your presence alters power dynamics and subjugates will.

---

#### Features

### Noble Presence
You gain proficiency in Persuasion and Intimidation. Whenever you speak with authority, creatures with lower CHA than you have disadvantage on checks to resist your commands or suggestions (not spells).



### Throne of Silence
You can summon a spectral throne as a bonus action, floating behind or beneath you for 1 minute. While active, you are immune to being frightened or charmed, and creatures that begin their turn within 10 feet of you must succeed on a WIS saving throw or have disadvantage on attacks against anyone but you until the end of their turn.



### Sovereign Decree
As an action once per short rest, you can issue a decree (choose one):

Kneel: One creature within 30 feet must succeed on a STR save or fall prone and be restrained until the end of your next turn.

Obey: One creature must succeed on a CHA save or use its reaction to follow a one- word command.

Vanish: One creature must succeed on a CON save or become invisible and incapacitated until the end of its next turn.



### The Crown Returns
When you drop to 0 HP, a burning crown appears on your head. You rise at 1 HP and radiate absolute authority. For 1 minute:

You gain resistance to all damage.

Your decrees no longer require an action.

Enemies have disadvantage on all saving throws against your class features.
You fall unconscious after 1 minute unless you succeed on a DC 15 CON saving throw.

### The Maw Unending
> The hunger never ends. Only your enemies do.  

An endless mouth exists inside you. It eats spells, weapons, and flesh. The more it feeds, the more power you channel.

#### Roleplay & Playstyle
- Build for melee brutality and resource devouring.
- Ideal for frontline disruption and magical denial.
- Thematically disturbing and physically overwhelming.
- Strong synergy with grapples, bite attacks, and consumable spells.  

#### Subclass Abilities
|Level|Feature|
|:-:|:--:|
  |3|Hungering Strikes|
|6|Consume the Fallen|
|10|Maw Manifest|
|14|All- Consuming|
---

#### Features

### Hungering Strikes
When you hit with a melee attack, you can deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage. You regain HP equal to the damage dealt. This increases to 2d6 at level 10. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.



### Consume the Fallen
When a creature dies within 10 feet of you, you can consume its essence as a reaction. You gain temporary HP equal to your CON modifier + half the creature's CR (minimum 1).



### Maw Manifest
You can unhinge your jaw to devour things not meant to be eaten. Once per short rest, you can make a bite attack (1d12 + STR/CON modifier necrotic damage) that can also target constructs, spectral creatures, or magical effects like illusions or barriers (DM discretion).



### All- Consuming
Your maw becomes a gate. As an action once per long rest, you open the void within. Each creature in a 15- foot cone must make a Strength save (DC = 8 + proficiency + STR or CON modifier) or be pulled to your space and take 6d10 necrotic damage. On a success, they take half and aren’t pulled. You regain HP equal to half the total damage dealt.

\page

#### Ashen Breath
*0- Cantrip Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You exhale a puff of grayish smoke, which spreads in a small cone before quickly vanishing. Creatures in the area must make a Constitution saving throw or briefly choke on the acrid air. On a failed save, a creature cannot take reactions until the start of its next turn. This effect does not work against creatures that do not need to breathe.

---



#### Blink and You Missed It
*0- Cantrip Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 rounds

You momentarily sync out of step with the immediate flow of time, creating a minor delay in perception.
 
Until the start of your next turn:
- Creatures that would notice you must make an Intelligence saving throw or fail to recall any details about your presence until you interact with them directly.
- If you attack or speak, the effect immediately ends for that creature.

---



#### Cauterize Through Time
*0- Cantrip Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: S
**Duration:**     :: 1 rounds

You snap your fingers through folded chronology, sending a burning ripple backward into a wound that never had time to close.
Choose one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 pyric damage (a combination of radiant and fire), and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or suffer Disadvantage on their next Concentration check before the end of your next turn.

---



#### Ceiling Watcher
*0- Cantrip Illusion*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 20 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

A barely visible eye- like shape appears on a ceiling, wall, or corner of a room. The illusion remains for the duration but does not actually perceive anything. Creatures unfamiliar with the spell must make a Wisdom (Perception) check to determine that it is not real. If they fail, they instinctively avoid looking at it or standing beneath it.

---



#### Cinder Veil
*0- Cantrip Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 5 feet
**Components:**   :: S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 rounds

A faint shimmer of embers rises around you, warding off the cold. Until the start of your next turn, you ignore the first 5 cold damage you would take. If you are in an area of magical darkness, the veil glows faintly, revealing your silhouette to creatures within 5 feet.

---



#### Clockless Chess
*0- Cantrip Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Components:**   :: S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

Summons an enchanted chessboard where the pieces move themselves. Unfortunately, the game always ends in a stalemate.

---



#### Conjure Mild Inconvenience
*0- Cantrip Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You summon a trivial but deeply irritating inconvenience to plague a creature or small area within range. No damage is dealt, and no serious harm is inflicted—just mild frustration.

Roll a d10 and consult the Chaos Table below to determine the exact annoyance:

---



#### Crawling Dread
*0- Cantrip Illusion*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You weave a subtle illusion into the mind of a creature within range, causing them to feel an unnatural crawling sensation on their skin. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature spends its next bonus action, if it has one, brushing at unseen shapes or shifting uncomfortably. This effect ends early if they take damage.

---



#### Dead Air
*0- Cantrip Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You disrupt sound waves in a localized area. Until the start of your next turn, all spoken words within range are slightly distorted, causing messages to come out garbled and difficult to understand. If cast near a radio or intercom, the device crackles with static for one round.

---



#### Dice Storm
*0- Cantrip Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You call upon the fractured laws of probability, summoning a swirling rain of polyhedral objects—tiny magical dice—within a 10- foot radius centered on you. The clattering projectiles slam into everything nearby.

Each creature of your choice in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 impact damage. On a successful save, they take half damage. The damage is nonlethal unless otherwise specified.

Chaos Surge:

Immediately after casting, roll a d20. On a natural 20, the dice manifest as larger and denser projectiles (e.g., d20s the size of coconuts). Choose one of the following critical effects, or let the DM improvise:- The target is knocked prone.- One object in the area is crushed or broken.- A random magical effect is triggered (see Wild Magic surge table).- The area becomes difficult terrain until the end of your next turn (covered in slippery dice).- You regain 1 hit point (the dice land just right to boost your morale).

---



#### Directional Sense
*0- Cantrip Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S, T
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes

You focus your senses, allowing the pulse of magic to resonate through the terrain around you. This pulse reveals the optimal path forward, guiding your movements with precision. Whether in dense forests, city streets, or endless hallways, the flow of magic sharpens your awareness of the shortest and safest route.- Effect:- For the duration of the spell, you gain the ability to automatically find the shortest path to your desired destination within range. This can be a physical route, avoiding obstacles like walls or difficult terrain, or identifying pathways hidden or obscured by illusion magic.- You do not become disoriented or confused by labyrinths, mazes, or other disorienting environments.

---



#### Dirge Pulse
*0- Cantrip Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You release a low, resonant tone that only the dying can hear. Any creature within range that is at 0 hit points and making death saving throws automatically stabilizes if it succeeds on its next death saving throw. If an undead creature is within range, it takes 1 cognitive damage as the resonance disrupts its form.

---



#### Doppler Sound
*0- Cantrip Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, T
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes

You attune yourself to the subtle shifts in the air, using the ambient sounds of the environment to perceive the movement of creatures around you. Through the echoes in the terrain, you sense the direction and speed of any creature moving within range.- Effect:- You can detect the direction and speed of any creature within 60 feet that is moving. This allows you to sense their general movement, such as whether they are approaching, retreating, or moving laterally.- You cannot detect the exact position, but you can pinpoint the movement relative to your position.

---



#### Drifting Echo
*0- Cantrip Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You release a thin pulse of sound, inaudible to the living, but receptive to echoes of the past.
 
For the duration, you can hear vague, distorted murmurs of events that occurred in the area within the past hour. These sounds are indistinct and fragmented but may provide clues about recent conversations, movement, or disturbances.

The clarity of the echo depends on an Intelligence (Investigation) check made against your spell save DC:

---



#### Dripping Hour
*0- Cantrip Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

Time fractures briefly around a small object of your choice within range. A flickering afterimage of the object appears where it was exactly one second ago, causing momentary confusion. A creature interacting with the object must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be unable to distinguish which version is real until the start of your next turn.

---



#### Dust Veil
*0- Cantrip Illusion*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S, T
**Duration:**     :: 1 rounds

A sudden gust of dust rises from the ground, swirling around you in a blinding veil. The particles obscure your form, making it harder for enemies to land a blow.- Effect:- When you are attacked, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll against you for the duration of the round.- The dust is drawn from the terrain, and the effect is strongest in areas where the environment is gritty or decaying (such as crumbling concrete).

---



#### Echo of the Lost
*0- Cantrip Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 15 feet
**Components:**   :: V, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You briefly attune yourself to lingering impressions of the past. You hear a single whispered sentence in a language you understand, spoken by a creature that was in the area within the past 24 hours. The sentence is random, chosen by the DM, and may or may not be useful. If no creature was in the area within that time, you instead hear a distant, meaningless murmur.

---



#### Echo of the Overheard
*0- Cantrip Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 15 feet
**Components:**   :: V, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

By attuning to the residual vibrations in the air, you briefly hear a snippet of a conversation that took place in the area within the last 10 minutes. The words are often out of context, distorted, or incomplete, requiring interpretation.

---



#### Echoing Stomp
*0- Cantrip Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feetradius
**Components:**   :: V, S, T
**Duration:**     :: Instant

You stomp your foot with great force, sending a shockwave reverberating through the wooden floor beneath you. The sound echoes with a force that temporarily disrupts your enemies.
- Effect:
- All creatures within a 10- foot radius must make a Constitution saving throw.
- On a failed save, creatures lose their reaction until the start of their next turn, stunned by the reverberation of the stomp.
- Creatures that fail the saving throw also take 1d6 sonic damage as the shockwave disrupts their senses.

---



#### Eclipse Touch
*0-Cantrip Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 rounds

You trace an arcane sigil over a creature’s skin, leaving behind a barely perceptible shimmer. The next time the target takes chiaric damage before the start of your next turn, the damage is reduced by 1d4.

---



#### Erased Footsteps
*0-Cantrip Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You alter the way a surface registers footprints. For the duration, a touched floor, rug, or dirt path erases any traces of movement within a 5- foot radius. Creatures attempting to track someone through this area must make a Wisdom (Survival) check against your spell save DC.

---



#### Expired Authority
*0-Cantrip Enchantment*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 rounds

For a fleeting moment, a creature within range instinctively hesitates, doubting its own authority. If the target is attempting to enforce a rule, issue a command, or exert influence over another creature, it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or momentarily second- guess itself, delaying its action until the start of its next turn.

---



#### Fabricated Memory
*0-Cantrip Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 5 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

By momentarily altering a minor cognitive detail, you cause a creature to misremember something trivial. It might forget setting its keys down, misplace an item it was just holding, or recall an insignificant interaction that never happened. The effect is fleeting, lasting only a few seconds before the mind corrects itself.

---



#### Faint Heartbeat
*0-Cantrip Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You attune your senses to the fading echoes of life. You become aware of the heartbeat of any creature within range, even if they are hidden or invisible, as long as they are not undead or a construct. You do not learn their exact location, only their presence.

---



#### Fascination
*0-Cantrip Illusion*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 12 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

A subdermal neurological impulse is implanted in the target’s cognitive prioritization center, making them incapable of focusing on anything but the caster.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save:

- The affected target follows the caster wherever they go, unable to take their eyes off them.
- If attacked, the target enters a berserk fury, attacking anyone who obstructs their pursuit of the caster (+1 to hit,- 1 AC).
- The target may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

You awaken the filth of the streets. Puddles ripple, dust rises, and refuse shifts unnaturally in a 15- foot cone originating from you. Creatures within range must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be briefly disoriented by the sudden movement, causing them to have disadvantage on the next opportunity attack they make before the end of their next turn.

*0-Cantrip Illusion*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

For a brief moment, reality forgets you. You become difficult to track—mundane security cameras blur your image, paperwork listing your location misprints, and witnesses second- guess seeing you.

#### Mystic Mussel
*0-Cantrip Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You conjure a small, ancient mussel in your hand—enchanted, annoyed, and tightly sealed shut. If anyone tries to pry it open, it vanishes with a faint salty pop, leaving behind only a briny scent.

If spoken to gently and respectfully, the mussel may whisper a cryptic phrase in an ancient tongue or forgotten accent. These utterances are rarely useful and often nonsense, though occasionally they align with bizarre truths.

Once conjured, the mussel lasts for 1 minute or until it disappears. It may be placed on surfaces, used as a very passive familiar, or simply admired.

#### Oxidized Strike
*0-Cantrip Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Melee
**Components:**   :: V, S, T
**Duration:**     :: Instant

You channel the corrosive forces of decay into your strike, touching a creature’s armor or weapon with a touch imbued with necrotic energy. The target suffers both chiaric damage and the physical degradation of their gear.- Melee spell attack: Make a melee spell attack against a target. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 chiaric damage.- Armor Degradation: If the target is wearing armor, their AC is reduced by 1 for 1 minute due to rust and corrosion weakening their armor.

*0-Cantrip Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You gain vague insight into the bureaucratic history of an object or document you touch. If it was ever officially filed, cataloged, or stamped, you receive a faint impression of where and when.

---



#### Poltergust
*0-Cantrip Illusion*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You gesture subtly, and a phantasmal breeze whispers through an area you can see within range. Curtains billow, candles flicker, papers shift, and cold air brushes the skin. Though entirely illusory, the sensation feels real—enough to distract, unnerve, or suggest a presence unseen.- The wind cannot cause harm or move objects heavier than 5 lbs.- Creatures within the area instinctively glance around. If they are unaware of you or expecting stealth, you may gain advantage on your next Charisma (Deception or Performance) or Dexterity (Stealth) check against them before the end of your next turn.

This 0- Cantrip is often used to haunt, mislead, or emphasize one’s words, and is popular among illusionists, tricksters, and dramatists alike.

**Casting Time:** :: Bonus Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V
**Duration:**     :: Up to 10 minutes

You conjure a shimmering blade of psychic energy in your hand, forged from your focused will. Choose any melee weapon form you are proficient with (no ammunition or thrown weapons).

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You form a sharpened shard of mental force—an arrow of intent, a spike of memory, or a piercing thought—and hurl it toward a creature within range.

Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 cognitive damage.

The shard is invisible to those without psychic sensitivity, leaving no physical trace. To mundane observers, the effect may resemble the target momentarily flinching or losing focus.

Thematic Delivery

You choose the form your psyslings take. Examples include:
- A crystalline memory dart
- A shimmering synaptic spike
- A phrase spoken backward that drills through thought
- A fractal glyph burned across the air

You call upon divine radiance to flare from the gilded surface of the marble beneath you. The bright light sears those standing within its glow, casting shadows in the wake of its divine fury.- Creatures within 10 feet of the gilded marble or any surface you choose to target must make a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 chiaric damage.- Creatures that fail their saving throw are also blinded until the end of their next turn, as the radiant light temporarily overwhelms their vision.

---



#### Rail Arc
*0-Cantrip Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, T
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You channel a burst of static energy through nearby metal tracks, causing them to discharge a violent arc of electricity. The electric current surges through the rails, shocking any creature in proximity.- Creatures within 10 feet of any metal track or rail you target must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 electric damage.- If the target is wearing metal armor or wielding metal weapons, they take an additional 1d6 electric damage due to the conductive properties of the metal.

---



#### Redacted Statement
*0-Cantrip Enchantment*
**Casting Time:** :: Reaction
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You distort a single spoken word, causing it to be completely omitted from a sentence. This does not change meaning but leaves an obvious gap, as if the speaker momentarily forgot the word or it was intentionally censored. If used against a spellcaster, their spell is unaffected, but they experience a brief moment of dissonance.

---



#### Resonant Clang
*0-Cantrip Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 15feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, T
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You focus the sound of your steps and amplify the resonant clatter of metal beneath you, creating a sharp, ringing clang that reverberates through the environment. The disruptive noise causes nearby creatures to lose focus and become disoriented.- Creatures within a 15- foot radius of the source must make a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 sound damage and have disadvantage on Perception checks for the next minute as they struggle to recover from the ringing.- The sound effects can be heard clearly through solid objects, and creatures within range must make a second saving throw if they are engaged in any concentration spells or abilities. On a failure, their concentration is broken.

---



#### Reverb Cloak
*0-Cantrip Illusion*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S, T
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You attune your presence to the resonating echoes of the surrounding environment, causing your form to distort and flicker like a ripple in sound. In places with reflective or hollow surfaces, such as concrete tunnels or other echoing terrains, your form becomes harder to focus on, creating confusion and uncertainty.- The first attack against you each round has disadvantage, as your form fluctuates within the echoes, making it difficult for enemies to track your exact location.- While the spell lasts, you gain advantage on Stealth checks to hide in areas with echoing acoustics, such as tunnels, caves, or large, noisy chambers.

---



#### Rhythmic Movement
*0-Cantrip Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S, T
**Duration:**     :: 1 rounds

The natural flow of the parquet wood beneath you guides your movements as you flicker momentarily between positions, destabilizing your form and reappearing in a more advantageous stance.- You gain advantage on your next Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or melee attack roll made before the end of your next turn.- If you are within 5 feet of a surface or object (like a wall or ledge), you can use your bonus action to teleport up to 10 feet in any direction within range. This teleportation does not provoke opportunity attacks.

---



#### Runes of Inconsequence
*0-Cantrip Illusion*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You inscribe a rune onto a piece of paper, document, or surface. The rune hums with unstable magical nonsense, waiting for the next creature to read or open the marked object. When triggered, the rune unleashes a harmless but dramatic effect that startles, annoys, or mildly entertains.

The effect is randomly determined by rolling a d6:

The rune fades after being triggered. A creature that succeeds a DC 13 Arcana check while inspecting the document can spot the rune before triggering it.

---



#### Sanguine Ink
*0-Cantrip Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: S, R
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes

You conjure a thin line of crimson ink, written in your own blood, onto a surface within reach. The writing is in a language you know and can be as fine or elaborate as desired. You can erase the writing at will, but others cannot remove it by mundane means. The ink dries immediately and cannot be smudged. If used on a creature’s skin, it fades naturally in 24 hours.

---



#### Scorned Mark
*0-Cantrip Illusion*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: S, R
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes

You inscribe an invisible sigil onto a creature or surface—an anomalous imprint that flickers just outside visible light. The mark is imperceptible to normal senses but can be perceived by you, and by others under the effects of an attunement protocol (such as *Reveal Transmission*, *Trace Anomaly*, or *See the Unseen*). 

You may choose one of the following effects for the mark: 
- It emits a subtle warmth or chill to those who touch it. 
- It causes a sense of unease or dread when handled. 
- It makes the marked object feel subtly *wrong* to the attuned. 

If placed on a creature, the mark persists until the duration ends or the target takes chiaric damage (1 HP or more). The sigil has no impact on gameplay unless revealed, but its presence may trigger paranormal sensors, bureaucratic alarms, or ritual interactions.

#### Seduce Hollows
*0-Cantrip Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 yards
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 24 hours

A binding ritual forces one or more undead entities into total compliance with the caster’s physical or emotional desires.

- The undead must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, they cannot resist the caster’s commands for the duration.
- If forced into pleasurable acts, they take 1d6 chiaric damage per instance of forced compliance.
- This spell is illegal under A.S.T.R.A.L. anomaly regulations and has severe ethical consequences.

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You invoke the name of something lost to time, letting its voice slip through your own. A creature of your choice within range hears a whisper from the void. It must make a Wisdom saving throw or become momentarily overwhelmed, causing it to miss the next verbal component it attempts to use before the start of your next turn. If the target does not cast spells, it instead hesitates, reducing its speed by 10 feet for one round.

---



#### Shadow of an Elevator
*0-Cantrip Illusion*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: S, R
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes

You subtly confuse the layout of a building. While active, any creature unfamiliar with the location might experience a brief moment of directional uncertainty—walking to an office they’ve used for years only to find a storage closet, or stepping onto an elevator that momentarily appears to be missing a button. The effect does not create actual spatial distortions but causes minor lapses in familiarity.

---



#### Shatter Step
*0-Cantrip Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 5feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, T
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You focus a controlled vibration into the glass floor beneath you, causing a sudden concussive burst that shatters the surface. The shockwave ripples outward, damaging those within range.- Adjacent creatures (within 5 feet) must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take 1d6 sonic damage and are deafened until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, they take half damage and are not deafened.- You suffer no ill effects from the glass beneath you, and you remain unharmed.

---

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

---



#### Sibilant Murmurs
*0-Cantrip Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 rounds

You whisper a fleeting phrase laced with unsettling intent, audible only to one creature within range.

---



#### Slick Shift
*0-Cantrip Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S, T
**Duration:**     :: 1 rounds

You move with the fluid grace of linoleum, your steps slick and effortless. Your body adapts to the environment, allowing you to glide over the floor, avoiding interference from foes.- You can take the Disengage action as a bonus action on this turn.- You cannot provoke opportunity attacks from creatures during this round.

While under the effects of Slick Shift, your movement feels smooth, and you can maneuver without interruption, easily slipping past those who would otherwise hinder your progress.

---



#### Slitherword
*0-Cantrip Enchantment*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 rounds

You speak with a voice that does not belong to you—layered, shifting, and wrong.
 
One creature of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save:
- The creature flinches involuntarily, disrupting its focus.
- If it takes an action on its next turn, it must spend its bonus action first, if available.
- If it has no bonus action to use, its speed is reduced by 10 feet instead.

 A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

#### Solid Footing
*0-Cantrip Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S, T

You draw strength from the stability of concrete beneath your feet, solidifying your posture and ensuring that you cannot be easily moved. Your connection to the earth gives you exceptional resistance to being pushed or knocked down.

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V

You attune your balance and momentum to the structural rhythm of your surroundings—metal beams, concrete ledges, scaffolding, and rooftop catwalks. For the briefest moment, the world feels designed for your movement.

Until the start of your next turn, your long jump distance is doubled, and you do not need a 10- foot run- up to make a long jump.

You stomp or strike the ground, and a violent pulse of force erupts outward from a fractured surface within range. The magic seeks instability, targeting seams and breaks to launch razor- sharp shards in all directions.

At Higher Tiers:
- If the caster is level 5 or higher, the spell can affect light armor.

**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 rounds

You speak a single- word command, encoded in an arcane cipher that only the intended target can comprehend.

If the target succeeds on their saving throw, they immediately sense that an attempt was made to magically influence their will, though they do not inherently know who cast the spell.

**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Permanent

You etch a familiar into your skin as a living tattoo. The familiar takes the form of shifting ink etched into your skin and cannot leave your body or manifest physically. The familiar is alive in magical essence but exists only as a moving design on your flesh.

While the familiar is inkbound, you gain the following benefits:- You can see and hear through the familiar as long as it is on a visible part of your body (such as your arm, hand, or face). While using its senses, you are deaf and blind to your own surroundings.- You can communicate telepathically with the familiar while it remains tattooed on you and is conscious.- When you cast a spell with a range of touch, the familiar can deliver the spell through you if the body part bearing the tattoo is used to make contact with the target.- The familiar cannot attack, interact with objects, or move independently from your body. It can crawl across your skin, shifting its location and appearance, but it cannot leave your surface.- The tattoo cannot be removed by mundane means and persists even if you are polymorphed or disguised. If the tattoo is destroyed or erased by magical means (such as dispel magic or a targeted ritual), the familiar is banished and must be recreated by casting this spell again.

The familiar’s design changes subtly to reflect its emotions or magical stimuli, often revealing moods, warnings, or arcane patterns.

You can only have one inkbound familiar at a time. Attempting to cast this spell again causes the previous tattoo to fade and the familiar to vanish.

- If provoked (e.g., accused, mocked, slighted), they must make a Charisma saving throw or escalate to physical conflict.

---



#### Midnight Admirer
*1st- level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You conjure an illusory, impossibly attractive individual tailored to a creature’s preferences—a glowing vision of flirtatious perfection. The phantom makes eye contact, winks, poses, and speaks with a sultry or suave voice. Only the target can hear its words.

When the illusion appears, all creatures within 10 feet of it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, they are flustered until the start of their next turn, suffering disadvantage on Insight and Charisma (Persuasion or Deception) checks.

The phantom lingers for 1 minute, continuing to flirt—but vanishes immediately if the target accepts a date.

If the target refuses, ignores, or reacts negatively to the offer during the spell’s duration, they immediately gain 1 level of exhaustion as their heart and sleep are cursed with regret, longing, and dramatic dream interludes.

Restless Charm:

If the target accepts the date, the illusion disappears with a delighted gasp—but returns during their next long rest, whisking them away on a surreal magical outing.
- The long rest is interrupted.
- The target returns in the morning emotionally drained, gaining a level of exhaustion.
- Additionally, they suffer disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws until their next long rest, as reality feels disappointingly dull compared to their spectral suitor.

If the target refuses the date, the illusion returns every long rest until they accept, interrupting sleep and causing 1 level of exhaustion each time. The illusion is more dramatic every time it returns.

Upon the 6th refusal the illusion will sip the beauty and vitality from the target incuring in the death of the target.

*1st- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet

You conjure a glowing, humming orb of soft pastel light that floats 5 feet off the ground and emits gentle music and phrases like:- “Let’s not do this.”- “Violence is exhausting.”- “Hugs not hits.”- “Come on, talk it out, champ.”

Each creature of your choice within a 10- foot radius of the sphere must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become non- hostile for as long as they remain within the sphere’s area.

They won’t initiate attacks, cast offensive spells, or shout mean things while inside—but they may still pout, sulk, or engage in passive aggression.

The Save DC is equal to: 10 + the creature’s Challenge Rating (rounded down)
This means tougher creatures are less likely to resist the sphere’s charm, because even ancient dragons want to be understood.

While active:- The sphere follows its original position and cannot be moved.- Creatures who exit and re- enter must re- roll their save.- Creatures who are damaged immediately shake off the effect.

**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

A shimmering halo of translucent red tape and arcane filing forms around you, swirling with stamps, forms, and glowing sigils marked “PENDING.” The attacker must now navigate a magical bureaucracy in order to strike you effectively.

For the duration, any creature that targets you with an attack must choose one of the following delays:- File a Complaint: The creature takes no action on its next turn, submitting to the magical bureaucracy.- Wait in Line: The creature loses 10 feet of movement for that turn as it’s forced to shuffle through conjured arcane queues.- Ignore Protocol: If the attacker does neither, their attack roll is made at disadvantage.

This effect persists for the spell’s full duration or until you are incapacitated.

You detect the presence of any internal affliction, including:
- Natural or magical diseases
- Poisons or chemical imbalances
- Curses with a biological or physiological component
- Arcane mutations or lingering experimental side effects

You immediately learn the type of affliction present (e.g., “necrotic infection,” “alchemical toxin,” or “soul- linked corruption”). You do not learn the exact name or nature of the condition unless you succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence (Medicine or Arcana) check.

Creatures without any detectable affliction feel nothing. Afflicted creatures may feel a brief sting, or other harmless somatic response depending on the nature of their condition.

#### Rodent of Frost
*1st- level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You summon a single, spectral rat formed of condensed frost and arcane chill. It scurries off immediately, following an inexplicable instinct.- The rat automatically seeks the coldest location within a 200- foot radius, regardless of visibility or accessibility.- It can sense cold through barriers, insulation, or seals—even within a hermetically sealed container like a locked freezer.- As it moves, it leaves behind a trail of tiny frost- lined footprints, which last for 1 minute before sublimating.

The rat is entirely uninterested in combat and disappears instantly if initiative is rolled or hostilities begin nearby.

#### Sensor Jam
*1st- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: up to 1 minutes

You overload a single electronic device, electronic entity or cybernetic implant with a focused burst of disruptive energy. Choose one target within range: 

- If it is a surveillance device (camera, sensor, drone), it becomes jammed or distorted, displaying static, looping false footage, or freezing in place for the duration. 
- Creatures relying on electronic optics or enhanced vision have disadvantage on Perception checks and ranged attacks.
- Devices with hardened shielding or advanced encryption may require a successful Arcana check (DC 15) to affect. 

The spell ends early if the device is destroyed or the caster loses concentration.

#### Severed Circuit
*1st- level Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You overload the neural pathways or electronic systems of a creature or machine. Choose one creature or construct within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, it takes 2d8 electric or cognitive damage (your choice) and is stunned until the end of its next turn.
 
On a success, it takes half damage and suffers no additional effects.

---



#### Signal Interference
*1st- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes

You generate a localized field of paranormal static that disrupts magical, electronic, and psychic signals within a 30- foot radius.
- Creatures in the area have disadvantage on concentration checks, and telepathic communication is scrambled.
- Technology in the area (including radios, cameras, and other surveillance devices) emits distortion, static, or visual glitches.
- The field is invisible, but anyone inside hears faint overlapping whispers, as though being tuned in and out of existence.

#### Sure Disease
*1st- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 20feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 3 days

You guarantee that your target contracts a non- lethal but incredibly annoying illness. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become afflicted for the duration. While afflicted, the target suffers one randomly determined symptom.

Roll a d10 on the Inconvenient Affliction Table to determine the effect:

#### Suspension of Disbelief
*1st- level Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V
**Duration:**     :: 1 hours

You briefly attune to the narrative fabric of reality, gaining an uncanny sensitivity to dramatic structure, clichés, and meta- patterns. For the duration, you can sense the presence of common story tropes in characters, environments, and events within range.

You can detect things like:
- When a villain is about to monologue
- If a side character radiates “tragic backstory energy”
- Whether a room feels “too conveniently empty”
- If an ancient prophecy is about to become relevant
- When someone is definitely about to betray the party

This insight is incredibly annoying to others. NPCs may roll Insight to feel disturbed by your overly convenient genre awareness.

Meta Mechanic (once per casting):

If the DM becomes visibly annoyed by your observations—subtly or overtly—you may “break the fourth wall.” When this happens:
- You may ask the DM one question about the current narrative, twist, or character.
- The DM must answer, but may do so cryptically.
- Your character forgets the answer consciously, but retains it subconsciously.
- The player gains one “narrative gut feeling” that can be invoked at any time for advantage on a single Insight, Perception, or Investigation check.

This ability can only be triggered once per casting.

#### Taunt the Fruit Boots
*1st- level Illusion*
**Casting Time:** :: 1 minutes
**Range:**        :: 120 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You channel your arcane energy into pure style and physics- defying balance. As part of the spell, you perform an absolutely sick trick on a skateboard (or any similar celebrityl transport device). The trick defies gravity, logic, and taste. Everyone nearby feels its impact.

Roll a Performance (Charisma) check. Choose one of the following based on the result:- 15 or higher: A nearby crowd gathers. If 5 or more creatures visibly react with awe (DM’s discretion), you gain advantage on all Charisma checks and Charisma saving throws until your next long rest.- 10–14: The trick works, but only a few bystanders notice. You gain advantage on your next Charisma ability check.- Below 10: You still land it… barely. No benefit, but you avoid humiliation.

This spell grants no combat bonuses and immediately ends if cast in combat.

---



#### Tether Hook
*1st- level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feett

You conjure an ethereal tether and anchor it to a visible ledge or wall.
- You may instantly pull yourself up to 20 feet toward the anchor as part of the casting.
- For the spell’s duration, you or an ally may use a bonus action to pull themselves to the same anchor.
- If the anchor is removed or broken, the tether snaps.

---



#### The Mourner's Kiss
*1st- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You infuse the Veins of Lament into a kiss, channeling raw pain through the moment of contact. When you touch a creature with your lips (or simulate the act with a somatic gesture), your magic delivers a pulse of internal anguish.

The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d3 chiaric damage plus 3 damage per caster level (maximum 1d3 + 20). On a successful save, the creature takes half damage.

This kiss leaves no visible wound, but the target feels as if something delicate within them cracked.

---



#### Truth Between the Sheets
*1st- level Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You exhale a slow, intoxicating breath, sending whispers of carnal truth and romantic echoes drifting into the target’s aura. The magic doesn’t extract facts—it invites revelation.

A silken mirage unfolds, where the subject’s soul steps forward, cloaked in glimmering honesty. Faces, forms, emotions, and gestures emerge from the haze—some familiar, some unknown—each representing a truth they’ve always carried.

The spell may reveal one or more of the following aspects, depending on your focus:

Gender Identity: The target's inner identity manifests briefly as a mirage, affirming their true self. This may reveal identities such as Male, Female, Nonbinary, Transgender, Cisgender, Two- Spirit, Genderfluid, Agender, or something uniquely celebrityl and beyond typical categories.

Romantic Inclination: You awaken a subtle echo within the target’s spirit, reflecting their romantic nature. This might indicate whether they identify as Hyper- Romantic, Romantic, Demi- Romantic, Grayromantic, Aromantic, or something entirely undefined.

Sexual Orientation: A fleeting, sensory dreamscape gently unfolds around the target, reflecting their deepest attractions. They may acknowledge, embrace, or gently dismiss these visions. The spell doesn't impose new desires; it simply illuminates those already present.

Position Preference: A subtle sensation reveals the subject's preferred intimacy position, such as Top, Bottom, Versatile, Vers- Top, Vers- Bottom, Side, or an unclassified, uniquely celebrityl preference.

Fetish Affinity: A delicate hum pulses into the subject’s subconscious, drawing forth hidden motifs of pleasure—those they cherish, those they deny, and those that whisper only in dreams. This may reveal affinities such as Bondage, Impact Play, Sensory Deprivation, Exhibitionism, Voyeurism, Power Exchange, Pet Play, or something undocumented by common texts.

Kink Role Alignment: A soft whisper coils through the subject’s awareness, coaxing insight into their innate position within dominance- submission dynamics. They may momentarily experience themselves in a state of control, surrender, or fluidity. Whether they resist, acknowledge, or embrace this vision, the spell merely opens a door—it does not push them through it.

The experience is not invasive—it is affirming, deeply celebrityl, and laced with quiet reverence. The subject may resist this unveiling with a Wisdom saving throw; on a success, the vision remains fragmented, and only a vague sense of their essence slips through.

This spell does not coerce. It does not judge. It simply illuminates what was already burning softly beneath the surface.

#### Urban Camouflage
*1st- level Illusion*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: self
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 hours

---



#### Wall of Farce
*1st- level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You conjure an illusory wall up to 5 feet wide, 10 feet tall, and 1 inch thick made entirely of bad visual gags and slapstick nonsense. Rubber chickens, cream pies, banana peels, and invisible panes of glass loop endlessly in magical animation. The wall occasionally emits groan- worthy puns, honking horns, or laugh tracks from nowhere.

The wall is not solid and can be walked through—but creatures who approach it often don’t realize it’s fake.

When a creature comes within 5 feet of the wall for the first time on a turn or starts its turn near it, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become incapacitated with uncontrollable laughter until the start of its next turn.

A creature that investigates the wall (as an action) may make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, it sees through the illusion—the wall disappears for that creature only.

The spell ends early if you lose concentration or dismiss it.

---



#### Wanton Assessment
*1st- level Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You brush your fingers gently across the target’s skin, and for a moment, their body opens itself to your senses—like a lover whispering its deepest discomforts.

You detect any sexual or intimacy- related ailments currently affecting the creature, whether physical, psychological, emotional, or arcane. This includes but is not limited to:
- Venereal diseases, mundane or magical
- Hormonal imbalances, arousal anomalies, arcane sterility
- Psychological blocks, trauma- induced aversions, or compulsions
- Magically- induced attractions, false bonds, or enchantments
- Anomalous intimacy curses (e.g., “can’t touch anyone,” “always fall in love,” etc.)

Each issue is revealed in poetic, metaphorical terms, such as:

“The heart is sealed with wax,” or “There is a hunger with no source.”

With a DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine or Insight) check, you may interpret one affliction literally.

An afflicted creature feels a brief sensation of heat or shiver, depending on the nature of the ailment. Some report hearing a whisper from within themselves.

---



#### Whispering Wine
*1st- level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You conjure a bottle of smooth, dark wine that whispers strange, cryptic advice to anyone who drinks from it. The murmurs are soft, slurred, and often incoherent—but they always sound meaningful… even when they aren’t.

Each time a creature takes a sip (a free object interaction), they must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or accidentally reveal a celebrityl secret aloud. The secret is chosen by the DM or the player, depending on tone.

The wine’s advice is usually:- Just slightly off- topic- Half- true at best- Or deeply unsettling with no context (“Beware the third fork…”)

---



#### Algorithmic Cascade
*2nd- level Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet

- On a success, they take half damage and suffer no additional effects.

**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 hours

You summon a localized, magical downpour of harmless frogs in a 10- foot radius area within range. The frogs immediately cover the ground, creating difficult terrain for the duration. They persistently croak in gentle harmony, producing mild distraction but no other direct harm.

When the spell ends, the frogs disperse naturally, leaving no lasting effect.

#### Automated Surveillance
*2nd- level Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: 10 minutes
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 hours

You summon an invisible, intangible drone that records everything within a 30- foot radius sphere for the duration.
 
- You may review the footage remotely at any time during the spell’s duration.
- If an anomaly or hidden entity is present, the surveillance feed experiences glitching distortions.
 
 If the spell is dispelled or the drone is discovered and disabled, all recorded data is lost.

---



#### Binding Clause
*2nd- level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 15 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

With a sharp gesture, you conjure a surge of bureaucratic force—spectral office forms, glowing seals, and red ink ribbons erupt from thin air, attempting to engulf the target in official documentation and bind them in place.
- Choose one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 impact damage and become Administratively Restrained.

While Administratively Restrained:
- The target’s movement speed becomes 0.
- They cannot teleport, shapeshift, or plane shift.
- The target must spend their action each turn to complete a different form (Strength [Athletics] check vs your spell save DC). On a success, they tear free from the binding.

---



#### Bliss on the Lips
*2nd- level Enchantment*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: S
**Duration:**     :: 1 turn

A kiss imbued with phantasmal delirium seeps into the target’s mind, unraveling their thoughts into surreal hallucinations.
 
- The target becomes heavily intoxicated, seeing phantom lights and distorted visions.
- They suffer disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Dexterity checks.
- If they fail a Wisdom save, they believe their deepest desires have become real, embracing illusions as if they were flesh.

---



#### Bullet Shield
*2nd- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Reaction
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 rounds

You create a brief field of kinetic energy around you. Until the start of your next turn, you gain resistance against damage from ranged weapon attacks. Additionally, any attacker hitting you with a ranged weapon during this duration takes 1d6 impact damage from kinetic feedback.

#### Chef's Keen Senses
*2nd- level Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

Your senses sharpen with uncanny focus as your tongue tingles and your stomach hums like a divining rod. For a brief moment, you are aware of all edible food items within 30 feet—whether fresh, packed, rotten, conjured, or stolen.

You instantly know the location, type, and state of freshness or edibility of every meal, ration, snack, feast, or bite within range—even if it is hidden, obscured, or magically disguised.

---



#### Commoner's Glow- up
*2nd- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 500 feet
**Components:**   :: S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You cast a luminous veil over a creature, causing their appearance to elevate dramatically in status and confidence. Their clothes become elegant or fashion- forward (appropriate to the culture), their grooming perfect, and their posture striking. Even their aura suggests wealth, success, or nobility.

For the duration:- The target is perceived as wealthier, more influential, or better connected than they actually are.- They gain advantage on Charisma (Persuasion, Performance, or Deception) checks made to impress, manipulate, or gain favor from upper- class individuals.- Creatures of lower social standing may act deferential or assume the target outranks them.

---



#### Compulsed Sponsoring
*2nd- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 500 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You infuse a creature with an irresistible compulsion to endorse a random corporate product. The target must make a Charisma saving throw or immediately produce a branded item from their person and begin promoting it in an unnervingly enthusiastic tone. The item:- Is conjured from a pocket, bag, or sleeve, regardless of size or logic.- Bears a fictional or obscure corporate logo.- Is typically useless, outdated, or completely unrelated to the current situation (e.g., toaster, pager, mascara wand, premium glue stick, commemorative mug).

While holding the item, the creature is incapable of speaking or casting spells unless their words involve endorsing the product. This effect ends at the start of their next turn.

On a roll of 1 on a d20 when the item appears, the product is mildly cursed—e.g., causes static shocks, whispers corporate slogans at night, or leaks black ink that can’t be cleaned.

#### Data Recovery
*2nd- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R

This spell removes the following conditions if they are the result of psychic overload, anomaly exposure, or cognitive corruption:
- Paranoid 
- Frightened 
- Stunned 
- Compelled 
- Aroused *(if caused by enchantment)* 

It does not remove magical Charmed effects or active enchantments. However, it halts the progression of long- term neurological decline, such as memory decay caused by exposure to forbidden glyphs, mnemonic rot, or containment leaks.

---



#### Dorkvision
*2nd- level Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You gain the uncanny ability to detect the presence of nerds, dweebs, and individuals of exceptional dweebosity within 60 feet—even through walls, floors, or ceilings. The spell provides no other visual enhancements: no darkvision, no object outlines—just a glowing nerd- silhouette pulsing with arcane awkwardness.

You do not learn the creature’s identity, species, alignment, or abilities—only that a certified dork is present.


When cast using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you also perceive the creature’s clothing—or lack thereof. However, the target becomes instantly and uncomfortably aware of being watched, regardless of distance, barriers, or logic.

---



#### Drowsing Embrace
*2nd- level Enchantment*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch

**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes

---



#### Duinir's Respite of Flames
*2nd- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: instantaneous

A flicker of protective warmth, traced from forgotten runes and smoldering remnants of a scholar’s last memory, pulses outward from your hands. You call upon Duinir’s ward—a memory, a flame, a sanctuary encoded in contradiction.

Choose up to 3 creatures within range. Each target gains 2d4 temporary hit points and becomes immune to the charmed condition for the duration.

While under this spell’s effects, affected creatures emit a faint, heatless ember- glow from their chest when they are emotionally manipulated or magically influenced—visible only in dim light or darkness.

---



#### Echo of the Hallowed Ground
*2nd- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Up to 1 minutes

While this spell is active, your aura reflects the memory of sanctified or desecrated ground. For the duration:- Your Aura of Sanctity applies even if the terrain is not currently Holy or Unholy.- You gain a faint glowing aura (or a flickering shadow) that reveals your allegiance.- If you cast Consecrate or Corrupt during the duration, the effect becomes instantaneous and cannot be interrupted by damage.

Note: This spell allows you to “prime” a battlefield without needing the terrain benefit immediately, making it more tactical.

---



#### Egress Protocol
*2nd- level Enchantment*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes

You press your hand to the target’s chest, and for a brief moment, you feel their heart stutter—then surge. Their pupils dilate unnaturally as arcane algorithms flood their nervous system, hijacking the primal circuits of fear and survival.

The creature’s body is overridden with reflexive escape routines. For the duration, they gain the following benefits:

- Their movement speed increases by 20 feet.
- They gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) and Strength (Athletics) checks.
- They automatically succeed on the first check made to escape a grapple, binding, or restraint.

---



#### Eldritch Intoxication
*2nd- level Enchantment*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You saturate the target’s nervous system with supernatural excess, overloading their body with pleasure, euphoria, and dreamlike sensations.
 
- They gain the Aroused condition. 
- They suffer disadvantage on Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws. 
- Their movement speed is halved as they drift and stagger in a dreamlike trance. 
- They begin to hallucinate, seeing fleeting images of former lovers, unfulfilled desires, or paranormal entities disguised as temptations (chosen by the GM).

If the target fails the saving throw by 10 or more, they lose all grip on reality—treating illusions as truth and mistaking allies for figments or phantoms. They become Paranoid and they cannot willingly target these hallucinated allies with hostile actions unless they are harmed first.

---



#### Electromagnetic Surge
*2nd- level Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S

---



#### Eyes Behind the Kiss
*2nd- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Special

The caster places a lingering, whispering kiss upon the target, sapping their very essence.
 
- The target loses 2d4 Strength for 24 hours, their muscles wilting as if touched by decay.
- For 1d10 turns, the target is completely helpless, collapsing under an unseen weight, as if an entity watches from behind their eyes.
- If the target is already affected by a Necromancy spell, it takes extra 1d6 chiaric damage at the start of its next turn.
 
 Those struck by this curse claim to see their own reflection smile at them, long after the caster has left.

---



#### Fauxshock
*2nd- level Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You designate a point on the ground within range. Instantly, a 20- foot- radius circle of artificial, plasticky turf unfurls across the terrain, complete with unnatural green coloring, chemical smell, and the vague scent of childhood disappointment.- When the field appears, all creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 electric damage as an electrical charge surges through the plastic blades.- For the duration, the turf remains charged. The first time each creature enters or starts its turn on the turf, it must make another Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 electric damage and suffer static shock- induced disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll or ability check it makes before the end of its next turn.- The grass is obviously unnatural and makes loud squeaking sounds when stepped on. It is difficult terrain for creatures wearing metal armor.

The turf remains permanently after the spell ends, though it loses its electrical charge.

---



#### Fire Colt
*2nd- level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes

You summon a tiny, fiery equine construct—a blazing colt no larger than a medium- sized dog. It snorts embers, kicks up sparks, and serves as both a mount and a living incendiary hazard.

The horse has the following traits:

AC: 14
HP: 20
Speed: 40 ft.
Resistance: Pyric
Size: Small
Ridable by Medium or smaller creatures

Abilities:
- Flaming Charge: As a bonus action, the colt can charge a creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 pyric damage and be pushed 5 feet.
- Explosive Dismissal: When the spell ends (whether voluntarily or involuntarily), the colt explodes in a 10- foot radius. Creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 pyric damage, or half on a success.

Unstable Nature:

At the start of each of your turns, roll a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the colt becomes unstable and explodes immediately, ending the spell.

*2nd- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes

You monitor a creature's vitals in real- time. If they drop to 0 HP during the duration, they immediately stabilize. If they were already unconscious, they awaken at 1 HP at the start of their next turn.

---

*2nd- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: 10 minutes
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: S, R
**Duration:**     :: 24 hours

You conjure a long, spectral table adorned with silverware, flickering candles, and translucent dishes steaming with ghostly food. The banquet is silent. No scent wafts from the platters. The air is cold, and time feels strangely still.

Up to 12 creatures of your choice within range may partake. Each creature that consumes the food must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw as spectral flavors and ancestral memories fill their senses.- On a success: The meal steels their resolve. They gain +3 bonus to AC and become immune to the charmed condition for 24 hours.- On a failure: The feast is too much to endure. They gain 1 level of exhaustion, as ghostly voices whisper forgotten griefs into their ears.- Regardless of the outcome, the meal nourishes the creature completely, removing hunger for the next 24 hours.

Once the meal is consumed, the banquet slowly fades, and only a ring of salt and ash remains where the table stood.

---



#### Ghost Broadcast
*2nd- level Illusion*
**Casting Time:** :: 10 minutes
**Range:**        :: 1 mile

You project an illusionary transmission onto any available public or private communication channel, allowing you to send pre- recorded misinformation, propaganda, or encrypted signals.
 
- The message appears real to all who hear it, unless they succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check DC 15.
- Corporate networks attempt to trace the signal, but the source remains undetectable unless hacked.

#### Ghost Circuit
*2nd- level Illusion*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 hours

You slip between digital signals, cloaking your presence from the eyes of modern surveillance. While the spell is active, the target becomes invisible to all forms of electronic detection, including:

- Security cameras 
- Biometric scans 
- Motion sensors 
- Augmented optics 
- Automated surveillance drones 

Any digital recording device attempting to observe the target displays static, blank footage, looping segments, or null reads. Creatures relying on standard, unaided senses can still see and interact with the target as normal.

If the affected creature directly interacts with an electronic device (e.g., hacking a terminal or opening a scanned door), the system may register anomalies or error codes but not the user's identity.

#### Giocrin's Face of Rust
*2nd- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You release a conical wave of decaying shadow that unravels matter and memory. Each creature in a 20- foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 chiaric damage and cannot regain hit points until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and suffers no additional effects.

When casting this spell, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher, reality trembles—a barely perceptible ripple distorts the air, leaving behind a faint trace of something watching. This has no mechanical effect, but those attuned to anomalies may notice.

---



#### Heat Void
*2nd- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch (1 forge, anvil, or crafeeting station)
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 hours

You channel an ancient thermal anomaly into a modern workspace—be it a forge, workshop, or urban fabrication station. The air hums silently, and metal tools quiver unnaturally as the void- heat replaces all natural flame.

While active, the workspace becomes suffused with an invisible, willful heat that alters material behavior:
- Metals become pliable by hand, able to be reshaped or fused without tools—however, if the intended design contradicts some unknown property of the metal, it violently rejects reshaping (DM's discretion, may cause backlash).
- Electronics overheat without smoke or failure, entering a dormant "flicker" state where signals become erratic or unpredictable.
- Synthetic materials fuse or warp, producing hybrid composites with anomalous properties (e.g., rubber- steel, memory plastic with bone- like texture).
- Bone, ivory, or ceramic embedded in the field becomes magnetized to nearby metal, creating eerie pseudo- biotech components.
- Anything crafted or altered under the void- heat retains warmth for 72 hours and radiates a low hum in radio frequencies.

While under this effect:
- Smiths gain advantage on crafting checks involving metal, bone, or composite materials.
- Crafted items may gain anomalous traits at the GM’s discretion (e.g., whispering edges, resistance to mundane corrosion, mild telepathic signature).

#### Keeper’s Sanctuary
*2nd- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10- feet radius
**Components:**   :: V, S, T
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes

You create a Holy or Unholy ward centered on you. Choose one:
- Holy: Enemies must make a Wisdom saving throw to enter. On failure, they are pushed 10 ft and cannot re- enter for 1 minute.
- Unholy: Enemies entering take 1d6 necrotic damage and suffer disadvantage on saves vs fear and charm.

This does not count as a full Consecrate/Corrupt zone, but can bridge battlefield positioning and control.

---



#### Lockstep
*2nd- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You align your movement signature with that of the last creature whose ID you possess. For the duration, security systems, biometric locks, and tracking software register you as that person.

---



#### Mandatory Compliance Policy
*2nd- level Enchantment*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes

You invoke a mandatory compliance policy, compelling a creature to act in accordance with an official directive.
 
- The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they must follow a simple command (e.g., "deliver this package," "leave the premises," "cease operations").
- Unlike traditional enchantments, the target rationalizes their compliance within a corporate, legal, or procedural framework.
- If the command violates established company policy (or contradicts the target’s contract obligations), they automatically succeed on the saving throw.
- The spell fails entirely if there is no plausible procedural justification for the action.

---



#### Manifest Arsenal
*2nd- level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Bonus Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You conjure a floating, spectral weapon that resembles an industrial tool—an arc welder, a hydraulic press, or a razor- edged gear. The weapon hovers in a space you choose and makes melee spell attacks against a creature within 5 feet of it. The weapon deals impact or tearing damage (your choice) equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting modifier.

---



#### Mirabel's Kiss of Dawnbreaking
*2nd- level Enchantment*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

A brief biometric transfer stimulates the target’s central nervous system, instantly eliminating exhaustion, hangovers, and sleep deprivation.

- The target gains the benefits of a long rest (except for spell slot recovery).

#### Phantasmal Cooler
*2nd- level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You conjure an illusory, self- chilling cooler containing up to 3 beverages of your choosing, tailored to the caster’s subconscious preferences. The drinks feel real, taste perfect, and provide subtle magical effects—so long as you don’t try to drink them.

Whenever a creature attempts to drink from the cooler:- The beverage vanishes just before reaching their lips.- The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be momentarily phased out of sync with reality, vanishing into a harmless demi- plane of thirst for 1 minute (as if banished). They reappear in the same spot, mildly irritated.

As long as the cooler remains untouched:- Any creature within 10 feet gains resistance to heat exhaustion and advantage on Constitution checks to resist dehydration or sun exposure.- The area around the cooler remains pleasantly chilled, creating a 20- foot- radius comfort zone in hot climates.

---



#### Phantom Call
*2nd- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 hours

You leave a lingering cognitive echo in an object. At any point during the duration, you may mentally transmit a single message (up to 25 words) that will be heard by anyone within 30 feet of the object as if it were ringing.

---



#### Pillow Talk
*2nd- level Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 turn/level

This spell reconstructs the ambient sensations, whispers, and tactile imprints of previous intimate engagements within a location.
 
While harmless, the effect warps local reality, causing phantom touches, faint breathing, and glimpses of past moments that linger in the space. This spell is illegally used in corporate surveillance and high- end brothel atmospherics.
 
- A creature charmed by you automatically fails the saving throw for this spell.

---



#### Precision Aim
*2nd- level Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

Your vision sharpens, highlighting enemy weak points. During the spell's duration, once per turn, your firearm attacks deal an additional 1d6 damage. Additionally, you ignore penalties from long- range firing and half- cover.

---



#### Protocol Override
*2nd- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes

You implant a directive into a construct or cybernetic entity. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they are charmed by you and obey simple mental commands, such as “Protect me,” or “Shut down.” This does not work on fully sentient AIs.

---



#### Regulated Fertility Control
*2nd- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: 10 minutes
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Permanent (until revoked)

A state- issued biological override ensures total reproductive regulation, granting or preventing fertility based on anomalous genetic programming or corporate mandates.
 
- You must register the procedure within a recognized biological oversight agency or an equivalent A.S.T.R.A.L. fertility governance database.
- The recipient’s reproductive ability is altered per official documentation—either activated, suspended, or set on a predetermined cycle.
- A recipient may petition for reversal, requiring an administrative appeal and 48- hour processing delay.

- Attempts to circumvent the procedure (via dispel magic or natural means) trigger an automatic health verification scan, possibly flagging the recipient for investigation.

#### Remove Aromate
*2nd- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Reaction
**Range:**        :: 500 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You temporarily erase all aromatic substances within a 50- foot radius centered on yourself. Foods instantly become tasteless, perfumes and deodorants lose their fragrance, and creatures develop noticeably unpleasant body odors or breath as natural smells dominate.

Creatures within the affected area become distracted by the sudden lack or distortion of familiar aromas. Any creature attempting Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Insight) checks relying on smell within the spell’s radius does so at disadvantage.

When the spell ends, aromas slowly return to normal over the next minute.

Roleplay Suggestions:- This spell could disrupt diplomatic meetings or social gatherings.- Restaurants or perfumers may ban this spell outright, viewing it as destructive or offensive.

At Higher Levels (Scaling):- When cast using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the radius increases by 20 feet per spell level above 2nd.- At 5th level or higher, the spell can selectively erase stronger or more specific aromatics (such as poisons, toxins, or pheromones), possibly neutralizing their effects temporarily.

---



#### Residual Anomaly Energy
*2nd- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

---



#### Residual Imprint
*2nd- level Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You touch a surface and pull residual emotions, whispered words, and sensory echoes from its past. These are not spirits, but impressions left by heightened emotions—love, fear, guilt, rage.
 
- As long as you concentrate, you experience faded flashes of what transpired in the location over the last 24 hours (or up to 10 years for a higher- level cast).
- You may see blurred faces, hear indistinct voices, or feel the emotions of the past occupants.
- If a violent crime was committed here, the spell may temporarily create an echo, repeating the event as a flickering hallucination that others can witness.

---



#### Salt Key
*2nd- level Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You channel a fleeting pulse of arcane code into a digital system, spoofing credentials and bypassing access protocols. When you touch an electronic device—such as a keypad, terminal, biometric scanner, or smart lock—you override its access layer and temporarily gain full control.

- Simple security (home locks, office terminals, consumer- grade encryption) is bypassed automatically.
- High- security systems (e.g., bank vaults, government archives, corporate mainframes) require a successful Intelligence (Arcana) check against the system’s encryption level (see table).
- This spell does not affect physical locks without a digital component.
- If used on a connected network, the intrusion is notified to its host system within 1 minute, unless the caster succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence check (if applicable).

---

---



#### Sensation Latency Buffer
*2nd- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 rounds/level

ou momentarily desynchronize a creature’s nervous system, buffering their physical sensations and emotional feedback.

Choose one creature within range. For the duration:
- The target ignores the effects of being frightened, charmed, or in pain (such as nonlethal levels of exhaustion or ongoing damage that causes distraction) until the start of their next turn.
- All delayed effects (such as damage from heat metal, poison, or emotional conditions) are postponed until the end of the spell’s duration, then occur all at once.
- When the spell ends, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they are stunned until the end of their next turn, overwhelmed by the sudden backlog of sensation.

---

**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: up to 1 minutes

Your firearm becomes supernaturally silent. Attacks made with this firearm produce no sound and cannot be traced by normal hearing or electronic sound detection. 
Additionally, enemies within 30 feet have disadvantage on Perception checks to pinpoint your exact position after you attack.

---



#### Stack Overflow
*2nd- level Enchantment*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

The target’s short- term memory floods with useless data. The affected creature must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, they roll 1d6 and subtract it from all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for the duration. The effect ends early if the target takes cognitive damage.

---



#### Sterile Veil
*2nd- level Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 turn/level

You conjure a shimmering veil of pale green energy across the target’s skin, filtering their body from infection both mundane and magical.- The target becomes immune to contracting, carrying, or transmitting any disease for the duration.- Any disease currently affecting them is rendered dormant—its symptoms subside and it cannot worsen, but it is not cured.- While affected, the target emits a subtle aroma of antiseptic and burnt sugar. Creatures with keen smell may sense this aura.

If this spell is cast repeatedly on the same creature without curing the underlying disease, roll a DC 12 Constitution saving throw for the target after the third use in a day. On a failure, they gain one level of exhaustion as their immune system becomes paradoxically hypersensitive and destabilized.

---



#### Summon Pest
*2nd- level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Reaction
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You summon the pest—an immortal, mildly sentient mosquito designated Pest- 1 in A.S.T.R.A.L. records. There is only one such mosquito in existence, and this spell temporarily returns it from its dormant state. The mosquito appears within 5 feet of the most important person in the area (DM’s discretion) and begins an aggressive buzzing and biting campaign.
- If Summon Pest is cast again: Pest- 1 is not duplicated. It simply relocates to the new target, abandoning the old one unless they are still within 30 feet of the new caster, in which case it harasses both.
- If no suitable target exists: Pest- 1 vanishes into non- space until summoned again.
- If the target becomes untargetable (e.g., invisible, banished): Pest- 1 immediately shifts to the next most “important” person in the room.
- If someone other than the original caster uses the spell: Pest- 1 recognizes this and updates its priorities accordingly, often begrudgingly.

Mechanical Effect:
The affected creature is considered distracted for 1 minute:
- Disadvantage on concentration checks.
- Cannot benefit from the Invisible condition.
- Any attack rolls made against the creature have advantage if they rely on sound or movement (e.g., tremorsense or blindsight).

#### Tactical Enhancement Protocol
*2nd- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You optimize a creature’s response time. The target’s speed doubles, they gain a +2 bonus to AC, have advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and gain an additional action on each turn (Attack, Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object). When the spell ends, the target is unable to move or take actions for one round due to neural lag.

---



#### Tight
*2nd- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

With a sharp pose and a surge of magic, you conjure a flawless fit. The target’s attire realigns into immaculate tailoring—custom, luxurious, and sharp as their mood.
- While affected, the target:
- Gains advantage on Charisma (Performance, Intimidation, or Persuasion) checks made to impress, seduce, or intimidate.
- Radiates undeniable confidence and poise.
- Exudes a faint supernatural polish—fabric shimmers, collars hold, and hems never fold.

When cast on an unwilling creature, they must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or:
- Their clothing constricts for a moment, imposing disadvantage on their next Strength or Dexterity- based check or save.
- They suffer 1d4 cognitive damage from the sudden discomfort and embarrassment.

---



#### Toxic Stray
*2nd- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You gesture toward a nearby stray creature—be it a cat, pigeon, squirrel, rat, or even a raccoon—and imbue it with trace amounts of venomous energy. For the duration, the creature becomes semi- magical and mildly dangerous in unpredictable ways.- Choose or roll for a nearby unclaimed beast CR 0 or lower within range.- That creature becomes your semi- loyal venomous companion for the spell’s duration.- The creature cannot speak, but it understands your intent and can take basic commands (such as “harass,” “follow,” or “bite”).

While venomous, it gains:- A bite or claw attack that deals 1d6 toxic damage in addition to normal damage.- Creatures damaged by it must succeed a Constitution saving throw or suffer disadvantage on their next attack roll or skill check (your choice).

If reduced to 0 HP or dismissed, it explodes in a puff of neon- green spores and glittery hair, imposing disadvantage on Perception checks in a 5- ft radius until the end of the turn.

---



#### Unscheduled Maintenance
*2nd- level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 hours

A targeted building, passageway, or technological system becomes temporarily shut down for "repairs", creating an official- looking lockdown.
 
- Doors will not open, cameras cease recording, and security systems display a “DOWN FOR MAINTENANCE” error.
- Employees or passersby will subconsciously believe the closure is valid unless they succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence check.

---



#### Verdant Irony
*2nd- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: self
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 hours

You ironically invoke nature in the concrete- dominated Concord City, spontaneously causing lichen and moss to rapidly grow and spread in a 30- foot radius around you, covering surfaces and structures alike.

Choose one creature within range (including yourself). If the target is willing, it gains a friendly affinity with this newly grown environment: the lichen subtly helps them navigate and move effortlessly, granting them advantage on Dexterity checks within the area.

An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed by the aggressive lichen growth, which actively attempts to hinder and trip them, imposing disadvantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws within the affected area.

The effect lasts for up to 1 hour or until dispelled.

Additionally, while within the area of the spell, affected creatures occasionally notice flickering glimpses of a serene, lush, and seemingly para- dimensional park hidden within reality. They never fully access this realm, experiencing only a tantalizing vision of what Concord City might have been.

---



#### Vital Threshold
*2nd- level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: up to 1 minutes

You conjure a glowing arcane wall in a space you can see within range. The wall forms a shimmering force field up to 10 feet wide, 10 feet tall, and 1 foot thick. When you cast the spell, choose one creature type (such as Humanoid, Undead, Construct, Beast, etc.).

For the duration:- When a creature of the chosen type passes through the wall, it regains 1d6 hit points and gains temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.- When a creature of any other type passes through the wall, it takes 2d6 necrotic damage.

Each creature can only pass through the wall once per round.

After a creature passes through the wall (regardless of type), it becomes solid, preventing further passage by that creature or others for the rest of the round. At the start of your next turn, it becomes intangible again, ready for another passage.

The wall is automatically dispelled after a number of total passages (of any type) equal to your caster level.

---



#### Wallflower Perk
*2nd- level Illusion*
**Casting Time:** :: Reaction
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

When a spell is cast nearby, you instinctively deflect attention by projecting a spectral version of yourself into a nearby corner. The illusory duplicate radiates an aura of intense social discomfort, misdirecting attention away from you.

For the duration, creatures within 30 feet must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when they attempt to target you with an attack, spell, or ability. On a failure, they ignore you entirely, unable to focus on your presence unless you directly harm them or force a saving throw.

This is not invisibility—you remain visible, but socially unnoticeable in a way that feels wrong. Even allies may forget you’re present.

---



#### Zenith of Crimson Greed
*2nd- level Illusion*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You touch the ground and whisper a name you barely remember. From your footsteps outward, false tracks begin to form—hoofprints, boot treads, claw marks, or even monstrous trails not known to local fauna. The chosen prints spread outward within a 15- foot cube, weaving seamlessly between your real path and the illusions.

These false tracks do not erase your actual trail, but instead obscure, redirect, or convolute it—causing anyone attempting to track you to suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to follow your true movements. A creature that examines the tracks closely can make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to discern the deception.

You may choose up to 2 distinct track types, layering them for added confusion. The illusion remains even through moderate weather or foot traffic but fades exactly 36 hours after casting.

---



#### Audit Strike
*3rd- level Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

A flash of judgmental energy rips through the target, determining its existential worth. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they take 6d8 impact damage. If the target is an extraplanar entity or has been altered by an anomaly, they also suffer disadvantage on their next saving throw before the end of their next turn.
 
 On a success, they take half damage.

---



#### Call the Artillery
*3rd- level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 120 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: up to 1 minutes

You conjure a semi- sentient spectral artillery construct at a point within range. It appears as a spectral gun emplacement or anomalous heavy weapon fused with meat and machine, powered by memory and trauma. It acts on your initiative (after your turn), and automatically targets enemies within range.
- The Echo Battery can target one creature within 120 feet and automatically fires each round unless destroyed or dismissed.
- Its attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance.

---



#### Cease and Desist
*3rd- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

With a gesture of bureaucratic authority, you impose a legalistic anomaly upon a target, making it impossible for them to take action until the proper paperwork is processed—which, conveniently, never arrives.
 
- The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they experience an overwhelming sense of procedural restriction, unable to move, attack, or take actions unless they can successfully "file an appeal" at the end of each of their turns (Wisdom saving throw).
- If they attempt to physically force through the effect, they must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, an invisible wall of legal precedent pushes them back 5 feet and the words "ACCESS DENIED" momentarily appear in the air.

---



#### Cerulean Incantation of Pride
*3rd- level Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V
**Duration:**     :: up to 1 minutes

With a single chant, a surge of prideful energy wraps around your chosen target. This incantation shields them with an aura of indomitable will, reducing the severity of blows that might otherwise pierce their resolve.

Choose one creature within range. The target gains resistance to critical hits for the duration of the spell—any critical hits against them are instead treated as normal hits.

---



#### Compelled Broadcast
*3rd- level Enchantment*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

By invoking an obligatory disclosure clause, you compel a creature within range to publicly state an official message, as though it were a corporate press release or legally mandated testimony.
 
- The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they must immediately speak a declarative statement chosen by the caster.
- The speech must be delivered in an official tone, and the target will rationalize why they are making the statement as though it were a compliance requirement.
- If the statement is factually untrue, the target may attempt a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each turn to shake off the compulsion.
 
- If the caster is wearing an official uniform, badge, or legal insignia, the target has disadvantage on their saving throw.

---



#### Corporate Armor Reinforcement
*3rd- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R

**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes

Up to four creatures of your choice gain temporary hit points equal to 3d8 + your spellcasting modifier and a +1 bonus to Constitution saving throws. However, once the spell ends, each creature gains one level of exhaustion unless they spend an hour resting.

#### Crash Override
*3rd- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Reaction
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You delete yourself from real- time monitoring systems. For the duration:
- Cameras, sensors, and divination magic cannot perceive you.
- If you are already being tracked, the last known location remains frozen as if you never moved.
- Any tracking spells fail unless the caster makes an Intelligence saving throw against your spell DC.

---



#### Crash Report
*3rd- level Enchantment*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, their mind experiences a catastrophic logical error, freezing their ability to process information. They cannot take actions, bonus actions, or reactions, and automatically fail Intelligence- based checks and saves for the duration.
 
 At the end of each of its turns, the target may repeat the saving throw. On a success, they recover their mental faculties and the spell ends.

#### Data Corruption
*3rd- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Permanent

This spell scrambles, distorts, or falsifies data rather than erasing it, creating misleading, contradictory, or corrupted information.

- Digital records are glitched, filled with anomalies, false timestamps, and conflicting logs.
- Physical records appear heavily altered or rewritten, as if they’ve been tampered with.
- Magical records (divination- based archives, memory storage, etc.) become unreliable, causing vague or conflicting results when reviewed.
- Anyone analyzing the data must make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to notice inconsistencies.
 
 The corruption is permanent unless manually repaired by a skilled technician, hacker, or archivist.

*3rd- level Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action

**Components:**   :: V, S, R

#### Delayed Nap
*3rd- level Enchantment*
**Casting Time:** :: Reaction
**Range:**        :: 120 feet
**Components:**   :: S
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You designate a target and whisper a temporal lullaby encoded with latent enchantment. The spell does not take effect immediately—instead, you set a delay of 1, 2, or 3 rounds (your choice when casting). When the timer ends, the effect detonates.- The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or fall unconscious for the duration.- While unconscious, they can be awakened by taking damage or being shaken awake.- If the target is already asleep when the spell activates, they instead experience vivid hallucinations and speak in an unknown language. For the next hour, they have disadvantage on Insight checks and occasionally murmur anomalous phrases.- On a successful save, the target resists the effect and instead gains one level of fatigue for 1 hour, as their internal clock momentarily collapses.

---



#### Dimensional Slip
*3rd- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S

**Casting Time:** :: 1 minutes
**Range:**        :: Self (10- feet radius)
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 8 hours

You create a temporary extradimensional shelter, but its interior is never the same. Each casting opens a distinct pocket realm with unpredictable architecture—an abandoned office, a forgotten train station, a maintenance shaft that shouldn’t exist. The space is secure, offering rest and protection, but anomalies sometimes manifest inside, leaving subtle signs that the shelter was briefly occupied by something else.

---



#### Discover Unseen Trace
*3rd- level Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Reaction
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 30 minutes

You attune your senses to latent traces left behind by recently departed creatures. For the duration, you can perceive invisible bio- trails, residual aura smudges, or paranormal displacement fields that linger behind living beings.- Within a 60- foot radius, you can detect the most recent trace left by any creature that passed through in the last hour.- The trace manifests as a faint shimmer, footprint, or scent only you can perceive.- On close inspection (action), you can learn one of the following:- Species or general creature type (humanoid, beast, aberration, etc.)- Time since presence- Anomalous conditions, such as illness, magical residue, or emotional trauma

**Components:**   :: V, S, R

#### Encrypted Containment Protocol
*3rd- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Until dispelled

You inscribe a high- security enchantment on an object, entrance, or containment zone, preventing unauthorized access. This spell combines Encrypted Lockdown and Containment Directive into a more flexible form.
 
- The locked area cannot be picked, hacked, or broken without first making a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) or Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check.
- Magical attempts to bypass the lock (e.g., teleportation, phase shifting) require a DC 18 Charisma save.
- If the target is a creature (anomaly or prisoner), they must succeed on a Strength saving throw to force their way out.

---



#### Encrypted Mind
*3rd- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 8 hours

Your thoughts become fragmented and unreadable. You gain advantage on saving throws against mind- reading effects, telepathic intrusion, and charm effects. Any
 
 attempt to read your mind returns corrupted, incomprehensible data.

---



#### Encrypted Missive
*3rd- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You touch a piece of technology and mentally compose a message of up to 25 words. The message is instantly encoded and transmitted through digital infrastructure, reaching its intended recipient through an email, text, or unknown server. This spell ignores firewalls but cannot bypass total disconnection from a network. The recipient hears the message in their mind as if reading it, but it leaves no digital trace.

---



#### Enthralling Kiss
*3rd- level Enchantment*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: S
**Duration:**     :: Until dispelled or broken

You place an enchanting kiss upon a humanoid creature you touch, compelling it to regard you as an authoritative presence worthy of obedience. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw at disadvantage. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed, treating you as a trusted authority figure, willing to comply with most non- hostile requests and instructions.

While charmed, the target experiences a strong compulsion to remain within 10 feet of you. At the end of each of its turns, the target may repeat the Wisdom saving throw (without disadvantage); success allows it to move freely until the start of its next turn.

The charm persists indefinitely until it is dispelled, you become hostile toward the target, or the target takes damage.

---



#### Famine Birth
*3rd- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Until the anomaly resolves itself

You press your fingers against the target’s abdomen and whisper an incantation that only hunger understands. The body responds, but not in the way it should. Something takes root within the target’s form, but it is not life—it is absence made flesh.
 
- The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure:
- They become host to an Unborn Hunger, a parasitic void that feeds upon them instead of growing.
- Each long rest, they lose 1d4 maximum hit points, their flesh pulling taut over their bones.
- Their appetite vanishes—no matter what they eat, their body refuses to digest it.
- They can feel it moving inside them, shifting with breath, curling beneath the ribs.
- If reduced to 0 HP while afflicted, they do not die. Instead, their body becomes an empty husk, and something else uses their form.
 
 Ending the Spell:
- If the host wishes to remove it, they must cut it out manually, taking 4d6 tearing damage and making a DC 15 Constitution check to remain conscious.
- A failed removal attempt may cause the entity to take full control, wearing the host like a suit of skin.

#### Festering Graze
*3rd- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: S
**Duration:**     :: Permanent until cured

A touch laced with the essence of decay invades the target’s body, unseen and insidious. The rot festers quietly beneath the surface, waiting to unravel its host.- The target becomes infected with a random disease that is linked to the natural decay of the body. This affliction is dormant for three days, during which the target feels no ill effects.- After three days, the disease awakens. Symptoms manifest suddenly, accompanied by whispers of secrets and memories of decay that take hold of the target’s mind. Feverish visions and murmured words plague the afflicted, distorting their perception of reality.- A successful Medicine check reveals nothing unusual at first glance. The symptoms appear natural, as though the disease were always meant to be a part of the target’s life. No magical traces of the rot can be detected without specialized magic or knowledge.

Effect:
While the disease is dormant, the target remains unaware of the affliction. Upon the disease’s awakening, they suffer from both physical and psychological effects, with hallucinations and fever overtaking them. The whispers may speak of forgotten memories, lost opportunities, or cryptic warnings—each whisper an unsettling reflection of the decay inside them.

The disease is not immediately fatal but can lead to a slow decline in health, eventually debilitating the target unless it is cured. Cure Disease or similar magical healing can remove the affliction.

#### First Act Entrée
*3rd- level Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

Your eyes blaze with unrelenting presence, demanding the spotlight from all who meet your gaze. You become the center of the narrative—whether admired, feared, or hated.

Choose any number of creatures within range who can see you. Each must make a Charisma saving throw.- On a failure, the creature becomes overwhelmed by your presence:- It has disadvantage on attack rolls against anyone but you.- It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns or use its action to dramatically comment on you aloud—either praising, mocking, or expressing obsession.- It cannot benefit from being invisible or unseen while affected.- On a success, the creature resists the effect but still feels mildly unnerved, suffering disadvantage on Charisma (Deception) checks against you for the duration.

---



#### Flashbang
*3rd- level Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S

---



#### Ghost ID
*3rd- level Illusion*
**Casting Time:** :: 10 minutes
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 24 hours

You overlay a false bureaucratic identity onto a creature, making them appear as a registered employee, citizen, or authorized visitor.
 
- Corporate databases, biometric scanners, and ID checks recognize the target as legitimate.
- The illusion does not hold up under direct questioning—NPCs may notice inconsistencies if the target acts suspiciously.

---



#### Ghost Signal
*3rd- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You become a phantom in the system. Your body glitches between states, causing the following effects:
- You can move through crowds undetected unless someone is actively looking for you.


- You can phase through glass, chain- link fences, or doors that are not reinforced.
- You are immune to pressure- sensitive floors, security scans, and motion detectors.

#### Gluttonous Maw
*3rd- level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You tear a wound in reality, and from the rip emerges a swirling vortex of translucent gums and spectral teeth, chattering hungrily in the void. The maw floats inches above the ground, grinding with maddening rhythm as it devours sound, light, and matter.

When the spell is cast, and again at the start of each of your turns, all creatures of your choice in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw.- On a failure, they take 4d8 impact damage and are pulled 5 feet toward the center of the maw.- On a success, they take half damage and are not pulled.

Creatures reduced to 0 HP by this spell do not fall unconscious—they vanish with a wet snap, erased from reality until the spell ends. When it does, they reappear prone and unconscious in the center of the area unless they were stabilized or healed elsewhere.

The maw is difficult terrain, and non- magical ranged attacks that pass through it automatically miss due to the warping of space and air pressure.

---



#### Hemograft Steel
*3rd- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 50 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You perform a violent arcane gesture and speak a phrase in reversed syntax, launching a weapon directly into a creature’s body as if administering a twisted injection. The weapon disintegrates mid- flight and rematerializes inside the target.- Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 6d6 tearing damage and the weapon is embedded into their body.- Lingering Pain: As long as the weapon remains inside them, the target takes 1d4 tearing damage each time they take an action, bonus action, or move more than 5 feet.- Removing the Weapon: A creature may attempt to remove the weapon as an action. This requires a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the weapon is wrenched free, dealing 3d6 bleeding damage, and the target must immediately succeed on a DC 13 Medicine check or begin bleeding uncontrollably—taking 1d4 damage at the start of each of their turns until stabilized.- The weapon vanishes into ash if the spell is dispelled, the target becomes unconscious, or the spell ends by other magical means.- The original weapon used as the material component is destroyed as part of the casting.

*3rd- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 1 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes/level

This spell coats an organic surface with a self- replenishing, non- Newtonian lubricant, ensuring optimal fluid dynamics and friction reduction. The resulting material is sterile, hypoallergenic, and non- toxic, adhering to ASTRAL safety regulations.

*3rd- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Permanent (until nullified)

With a whispered invocation, you impose absolute certainty upon an event, ensuring it cannot be undone, altered, or reversed by normal means.
 

- When cast, you declare one simple factual state affecting an object, person, or event. This fact becomes legally binding in the fabric of reality.
- Examples include:
- "This door was never locked."
- "She was always employed here."
- "This bullet did not hit me."
- The effect cannot be dispelled, countered, or challenged by ordinary magic.
- A court- level anomaly nullification hearing (or a 5th- level dispel magic cast in a place of corporate power) is required to break the clause.

---

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 120 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

The caster instantly knows the exact location of their misplaced keys. Keep it as is. Unfortunately, this spell cannot retrieve them—it merely confirms they are somewhere deeply inconvenient.

---



#### Mass Redaction
*3rd- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet (up to 5 creatures)
**Components:**   :: V, S, R

---



#### Maw of the Forgotten
*3rd- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

A grinning slit opens across your stomach, chest, or throat—an extra mouth that was never meant to be there. The Maw of the Forgotten does not hunger for food, but for concepts, names, and existence itself.
 
- As a bonus action, you may attempt to devour an aspect of reality from a creature you can see within 10 feet. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure:
- They forget their own name for 24 hours.
- Any titles, contracts, or legal records referring to them become unreadable, as though they were never written.
- They suffer disadvantage on all identity- based interactions, including deception and persuasion.
- Each time the Maw feeds, it grows larger, whispering secrets only you can hear.

 Ending the Spell:
- If the caster does not feed it at least once per minute, the Maw becomes hungry, forcing the caster to make an Intelligence saving throw or forget their own past.
- Once the spell ends, the mouth does not fully disappear—it remains as scar tissue, aching whenever something forgotten lingers nearby.

#### Mellow Flow
*3rd- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 500 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

With a confident declaration of “I know a guy,” you tap into the power of connections and influence. For the next few moments, you can easily slip past social barriers, gaining a temporary edge in negotiations, or simply causing others to lower their guard. A subtle aura of calming energy surrounds the caster, creating an almost magical atmosphere of ease.- Effect:- The caster can bypass most social obstacles with ease, whether it’s convincing someone to lend you a hand, smoothing over a tense situation, or gaining access to a restricted area. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target’s defenses are momentarily lowered, leaving them more susceptible to your influence.

You choose which moments are erased.- The spell only works on unconscious or willingly sleeping creatures.- If this spell is cast on the same target more than once within a week, their memory begins to unravel:- They suffer disadvantage on Intelligence checks for 24 hours,- And 1 level of exhaustion if they fail a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw.

#### Mobster’s Favor
*3rd- level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 120 feet
**Components:**   :: R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

A tough and grizzled individual materializes before you, dressed in a worn, pinstriped suit and reeking of cigar smoke. He looks around with a mixture of confusion and irritation before fixing his gaze on you.

The tough guy is a capable combatant, able to assist in a fight with decent skill, but he demands upfront payment before lending a hand. He is not one for questions and will accept no explanation or excuses, only calling it “business.”

The tough guy has the following characteristics:- Celebritylity quirks:
1.Refers to you as “kid” and insists on using streetwise jargon.
2.Lights a cigar during combat and complains about how things used to be better.
3.Will break someone’s kneecaps or deliver a threatening glare in exchange for gold.
4.Makes vague references to “debts” that the caster “owes” him, but never elaborates.
5.Will disappear without a word once the spell ends, often in a puff of smoke, with a brief “yeah, yeah, alright” if given a sandwich.

Combat role: The tough guy is proficient in melee combat, dealing 1d6 + Charisma modifier impact damage per attack. He follows basic combat tactics, focusing on protecting you or the group, but is self- serving and won’t risk his life for anyone’s cause unless it directly benefits him. He will act once in combat, and his loyalty ends as soon as the fight is over.

Additional effects:- He insists on being paid in gold, and if not, he may hold grudges that result in negative consequences for future interactions.- After the fight concludes, the mobster vanishes mysteriously, leaving behind a feeling of “unfinished business.”

#### Muttering Solstice of Indignation
*3rd- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 turn

You whisper defiant syllables into the Weave, anchoring a sphere of uncooperative momentum into the world. Within the zone, tension hangs in the air—every movement feels optional, replaceable, or rebellious.

While within the sphere, each creature may choose at the start of their turn:
- Forego their movement speed for the turn to gain one of the following effects until the start of their next turn:
- +1 bonus to AC
- One additional weapon attack as part of the Attack action
- Advantage on the next saving throw they make

These choices must be made verbally—even whispered—causing faint echoes to ripple in the air.

- If the target is suffering from a corporate- induced cognitive debuff, it is instantly removed.
- If the target is unconscious due to neural overload, they immediately regain consciousness.

*3rd- level Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet

**Duration:**     :: 5 rounds

You designate an area as both sanctified and desecrated for 5 rounds. It counts as both types of terrain simultaneously.

While active:- All Sacred Footing and Aura of Sanctity benefits for both Holy and Unholy terrain are active.- Enemies within the area must make a Wisdom saving throw or suffer from Paranoia (disadvantage on Insight, Investigation, and saving throws against fear effects).- You may cast spells that require either Holy or Unholy terrain as though the condition is met.

This creates strange divine interference, and at the start of your turn while concentrating on it, roll a d6:- 1–2: Radiant burst (each creature takes 1d6 radiant)- 3–4: Shadow pulse (each creature heals 1 HP if undead)- 5–6: No extra effect

---



#### Paranormal Trace Obfuscation
*3rd- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 hours

You create an illusory masking layer that scrambles all attempts to detect or track a person or object through digital or magical means.
 
- Spells like Biometric Scan, or Digital Footprint Analysis fail to detect the affected target.
- Any attempt to track the target via facial recognition, digital records, or magical scrying produces false results.
- If someone is already tracking the target when the spell is cast, they must make a Wisdom saving throw or lose the trail entirely.

---



#### Phantom Paper Trail
*3rd- level Illusion*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes

You do not just alter a document—you bend reality itself to accept the forgery as true for a short period of time.

- When you modify a ledger, contract, employee record, or legal file, the spell imprints its existence into the fabric of the world, making it temporarily irrefutable.
- For the next 10 minutes, any creature reading or interacting with the altered document will believe it is correct, unless they succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check.
- Even memories are briefly affected—a guard whose records have been modified will recall seeing you enter.
- After 10 minutes, the false record vanishes, and reality attempts to correct itself, leaving behind only confusion and a lingering sense that something wasn’t quite right.

#### Plasma Breach
*3rd- level Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 120 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

A sudden rupture in local thermodynamic stability unleashes a violent burst of plasma in a 10- foot radius. Creatures within the affected area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, creatures take 6d6 pyric damage, or half as much on a successful save.

Objects and structures within the area are automatically damaged unless they have specific resistance or immunity to heat. The explosion leaves behind a brief wave of heat that lingers in the area, scorching the surroundings.

#### Power Surge
*3rd- level Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

The target’s body crackles with latent electrical energy, empowering their strikes. For the duration of the spell, the target deals 1d8 additional electric damage with weapon attacks and unarmed strikes.

#### Pulse Reaver
*3rd- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: S
**Duration:**     :: 1 rounds/level

You place your hand near the target’s throat, heart, or the air above their skin—never touching, yet always too close. With a whispered invocation, you invite the attention of something that drinks the breath between pulses.- The target loses 2 hit points per round for the duration.- The caster gains 1 hit point per round (up to their maximum).- If the target is reduced to 0 hit points this way, they do not fall unconscious immediately.- For 1 round, they remain aware but paralyzed, their vision darkening as they feel a cold, unseen presence leaning in, whispering promises only they can hear.- At the start of their next turn, they fall unconscious unless stabilized by magical means.

---



#### Redacted Trauma
*3rd- level Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You remove one Cognitive condition from a willing creature, allowing them to forget the most painful elements tied to their trauma. This could include the following conditions:
Paranoid, Aroused, Frightened, Stunned, Compelled, Charmed

The creature retains functional memories but is relieved of the emotional and psychological burden associated with the specific condition. For example, if a creature is Frightened by an event, they may feel no further fear from that specific trauma, but their memory of the event will remain intact.

This spell is effective at alleviating the mental burden caused by Cognitive conditions and allows the creature to act without the weight of the affliction temporarily affecting their behavior or mental clarity.

Note: This spell does not remove conditions related to physical afflictions, nor does it erase conditions like Blinded, Poisoned, or other non- Cognitive states.

**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 turn + 1 rounds/level

- The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become physically nauseated at the thought of intimacy.
- Disadvantage on Charisma- based rolls involving seduction, persuasion, or charm effects.
 
 The reverse of this spell, "Pleasure Numbness," removes all sexual or emotional distress responses for 24 hours, making the target indifferent to physical stimuli.

- Each turn, their shadow makes an unintelligible whisper, causing 1d6 cognitive damage to the target.

#### Sobriety of the Veil
*3rd- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 hours/level

A veil of otherworldly clarity shrouds the target, severing their mind from chemical, magical, or emotional distortion.- The target becomes immune to alcohol, narcotics, pleasure- enhancing magic, and any enchantments that manipulate perception or judgment.- They remain unnaturally composed, able to see through illusions, resist temptation, and stay grounded even in the grip of hallucination or desire.- The target cannot be charmed, intoxicated, or seduced for the duration.

*3rd- level Enchantment*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You unleash a burst of targeted emotional disruption based on the black site experiment RAGE- 031. One creature of your choice within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or succumb to uncontrollable fury.

While affected, the target is enraged, experiencing an irrational compulsion to lash out. At the start of each of its turns, roll a d6 to determine the target’s behavior:

The rage lasts for 1 minute or until the target takes damage. A creature under this effect is considered charmed by the rage itself and cannot willingly end it early.


When cast with a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you may target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

**Casting Time:** :: 1 hours
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Permanent

You carve a true name or concept into an object, binding it not just in matter, but in meaning.
 
- The engraving is permanent—it cannot be removed, altered, or counterfeited.
- If the object is stolen, broken, or lost, its owner feels its absence like a phantom limb.
- The item becomes "known" to reality—it cannot be easily forgotten, overlooked, or discarded.

- If used on a weapon or tool, its wielder feels more attuned to it, gaining advantage on rolls related to its use (e.g., Smith’s Tools, a specific sword, or a custom- built firearm).

*3rd- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 hours

You conjure an unnerving mask over your face, obscuring your true identity.

- You gain advantage on Deception checks, but all social interactions become deeply unsettling.
- Creatures who see you for more than 1 minute must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 15) or develop a deep fear of you for the next 24 hours.

---



#### The Jester's Wild Gambit
*3rd- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

Chaos hangs in the air, swirling with possibilities. You embrace the whimsy of chance, drawing power from fate’s unpredictable nature.

When you cast The Jester’s Wild Gambit, you surrender yourself to fate’s hands. Every time you make an attack roll or ability check, you may roll twice, taking the higher result. On a natural 20, the effect is magnified—doubling the result of your roll. But on a natural 1, something chaotic occurs. The DM may choose an unpredictable effect, such as disadvantage on your next roll, an unintended event that causes a distraction, or a minor but inconvenient consequence.

---



#### Unseen Bureaucracy
*3rd- level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You summon an invisible bureaucratic entity that sternly demands all paperwork within the spell’s area (a single room or similarly sized space within range) be immediately filed in triplicate. The entity is invisible but can be clearly heard shuffling papers and making disapproving murmurs.

Effects:- No creature can willingly leave the affected area until the demanded paperwork has been successfully triplicated (takes approximately 1 minute per page per copy).- If no paperwork is present, the entity magically conjures a tedious stack of administrative forms to fill out, provided along with quills and ink.- If cast outdoors or in an open area, the entity first casts “Remote Office,” instantly teleporting all creatures within 60 feet to a small, featureless office space filled with paperwork and uncomfortable chairs. Creatures remain here until paperwork is filed or the spell ends.

Failure to comply results in the entity issuing an “official warning,” delivered ominously yet politely, which no one knows how to appeal or what consequences it may hold (DM discretion).

---



#### Urge Unerring
*3rd- level Enchantment*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You align your body, mind, and bladder with an invisible thread of inevitability. For the duration, cosmic forces ensure your next strike is absurdly accurate—but only under strangely specific conditions.

Until the spell ends, your next attack roll automatically hits a target of your choice if any of the following are true at the time of the attack:
- You are actively urinating.
- You are within 5 feet of someone who is.
- You are standing inside a bathroom, restroom, washroom, or similarly designated facility—regardless of plumbing status.

If none of these conditions are true, you must spend an action miming the act of relieving yourself (DMs are encouraged to enforce social consequences) to activate the effect. Once the effect is used, the spell ends

#### Utallash's Persuit of Ceramic
*3rd- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Bonus Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: R
**Duration:**     :: permanent

You invoke a forbidden remnant of ancient magic, drawing from the chilling legacy known as Utallash’s Pursuit of Ceramic. Choose one creature within range; 
it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target suffers the following effects:
- The target takes 4d8 distortive damage as their identity begins to fracture, leaving a hollow, ceramic
- like resonance within their being.- They become a “Husk”: For the next hour, the target struggles to remember their own name, imposing disadvantage on all Charisma- based checks and saving throws.

Marked by the Void (Caster’s Consequences):
Every time you cast this spell, you become subtly marked by the magic. The mark grows stronger with repeated uses. You experience minor, unsettling phenomena:
- Your reflection occasionally blinks or moves independently.
- Your shadow periodically misaligns or lags behind your physical form.

After you cast this spell 3 or more times, you gain disadvantage on Charisma saving throws until you complete a long rest, as the magic slowly erodes your own identity.

These effects are cumulative but subtle enough to be hidden from casual observers—though those familiar with the Void’s whispers will recognize your affliction immediately.

Removing the Mark:
A Greater Restoration or similarly potent cleansing magic removes all accumulated marks from you, resetting the count.

#### Veins of the Forgotten
*3rd- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You allow your veins to forget their purpose, turning your circulatory system into something liquid, shifting, and unknowable.
 

- For the duration of the spell, your blood is no longer entirely inside you—it slithers beneath your skin, forming moving patterns, and drips onto the floor in places you haven't stepped.
- You gain the following benefits and consequences:
- Your body is semi- fluid, allowing you to squeeze through gaps no wider than 1 inch.
- You are immune to poison and diseases, as your blood is no longer organic.
- You take half damage from slashing attacks, but piercing attacks deal double damage as your body cannot hold shape properly.
- Each time you cast a spell, your blood reacts violently, causing you to lose 1d6 HP per spell level.
- If you reach 0 HP while this spell is active, you do not die—instead, your blood scatters across the room, and your body must be reassembled manually.
 

 Anomaly Effect:
- If used too frequently, your blood refuses to return to your body, forming an independent entity that watches you, waiting for an opportunity to replace you.

---



#### Velvet Undress
*3rd- level Enchantment*
**Casting Time:** :: Variable
**Range:**        :: 10 yards
**Components:**   :: S, R
**Duration:**     :: Special

With a deliberate and hypnotic performance, you begin a sensual dance designed to captivate a single creature of your choice within range. As part of the performance, you must remove one article of clothing per round. Each round the dance continues:
- The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, suffering a 
– 1 penalty for each round you’ve maintained the dance.
- On a failed save, the target becomes Charmed and fully fixated on your every movement, unable to willingly look away or take hostile actions against you for the duration.
- If the target is already Charmed by you when this spell is cast, the duration extends by 1 additional minute.

The spell ends early if the caster is interrupted, breaks concentration, or voluntarily stops dancing.

#### Vital Override
*3rd- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You restore a creature to life, provided it has been dead for no longer than 1 minute. The creature returns with 1 hit point, but its body bears an unnatural stiffness, as if something is keeping it running rather than fully reviving it. Until they complete a long rest, they gain one level of exhaustion.

#### Architect’s Collapse
*4th- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: 10 minutes
**Range:**        :: Touch (up to 10 feet of crafeeted material)
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Permanent

You touch a man- made structure or crafted object, forcing it to forget how it was built—not destroyed, just unmade in an orderly fashion.
 
- Wood, stone, and metal loosen, shifting into their component parts without breaking—a smith’s forge can be unassembled cleanly, a sword can separate into its blade and hilt, and a house can collapse into its original timber and nails.
- The process is reversible—the materials remember how they were once arranged and can be restored without loss if done within 48 hours.
- A structure undone this way cannot be reassembled incorrectly—if rebuilt wrong, the materials actively resist, snapping back into their original formation.

---



#### Biometric Recalibration
*4th- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You target up to six creatures, recalibrating their biological functions. Each regains 5d8 hit points and ends one condition affecting them (blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned). If used on constructs or cybernetically enhanced creatures, it also removes glitches or malfunctions.

**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes

---



#### Blasphemer’s Undoing
*4th- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Reaction
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

When a creature who has dealt necrotic damage in the past 24 hours enters Sanctified Terrain, you may call upon the terrain itself to reject them.

#### Chronoscour
*4th- level Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You unleash a violent pulse of temporal distortion that briefly accelerates and then reverses time for everything caught within it. 

Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take 6d8 temporal damage, their body suffering from cellular whiplash as it is forced to relive a few seconds of extreme physical stress in reverse and fast- forward. On a success, they take half damage.

Twist of Time: If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by this spell, their body appears to freeze mid- motion for 1 round, during which they cannot be healed or revived by any means—time refuses to move forward for them.

- You can also restore or fracture one 10- foot portion of the structure once during the duration (repair 30 HP or deal 6d6 force damage to weaken it).

---



#### Corporate Requisition
*4th- level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: 10 minutes
**Range:**        :: Self (10- feet radius)
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes

You summon a high- value corporate asset from a hidden supply depot or corporate black site. The item materializes in an unoccupied space within range, appearing with an A.S.T.R.A.L. authorization tag.
 
 The asset can be:
- A non- magical weapon, armor, or tool worth up to 1,000 gp
- A one- use prototype device (mundane item with a minor paranormal enhancement)
- A high- value corporate document (blueprints, security codes, classified memos)
 
 The item remains for 10 minutes before fading into an encrypted data lock. If destroyed or stolen, the caster receives a corporate reprimand, imposing disadvantage on persuasion checks with corporate agents for 24 hours.

**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You create a field of unstable time that warps the moment of impact. Creatures in the area take 6d10 cognitive damage and must make a Constitution saving throw.

- Higher- tier anomalies (CR 6- 15) must make a Charisma saving throw or become suppressed for 1 minute, temporarily losing any paranormal traits.
- Powerful anomalies (CR 16+) experience severe disruption, suffering disadvantage on all ability checks, attacks, and saving throws related to their supernatural nature for 1 minute.

**Range:**        :: 10 feet

**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes (or until exited)

You conjure a temporary "layover space", a pocket of non- time where events pause but awareness remains intact.
 
- Up to 6 creatures within range are shifted into an alternate copy of the location, appearing slightly out of sync with reality.
- Time outside continues normally, but within the layover, no external force can interact with you.
- Spells, attacks, and actions do not leave the space—but you can watch reality play out through an invisible window, letting you gather information.

---



#### Dissonant Gestation
*4th- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: 1 hours
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Permanent (until birth or surgical removal)

You implore the dark corners of reality to place an unseen burden within a creature’s body—not a pregnancy, but an unnatural gestation, a thing that grows, waits, and feeds.
 
- The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, something begins to gestate inside them, though it is not a living creature as they understand it.
- Each week, roll a d6 to determine the nature of the thing growing within:
- 1 | Bone Nesting – The target’s bones begin splitting, reforming, and growing redundantly, fusing in painful, alien configurations.
- 2 | Chitinous Hatchery – Their flesh hardens into a shell, and something moves beneath it. It will hatch, but no one knows what.
- 3 | Hollow Incubation – The target’s organs begin to disappear, one by one, yet they remain alive, feeling the empty space within.
- 4 | Blood Evolution – Their blood is no longer theirs, but something else’s, moving independently, making them a host for an unseen parasite.
- 5 | Neural Infestation – The target begins hearing a second set of thoughts inside their mind. These are not theirs. They whisper secrets.
- 6 | Aberrant Bloom – Strange tendrils or appendages occasionally emerge from the target’s body, retreating before they can be seen.
 
 Ending the Spell:
- If left untreated, at the end of three months, the thing inside them will be born. The result is not predictable, and it may not be survivable.
- The only way to remove the gestation is through surgery or another, more powerful anomaly.

*4th- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You exhale a shriek that does not come from your lungs. It comes from somewhere much deeper—a place beneath time and flesh. The wail drags the psychic residue of forgotten horrors into the minds of those who hear it.

Each creature in a 30- foot cone must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is frightened for 1 minute. If the creature fails by 5 or more, it also suffers 5d6 cognitive damage as ancestral screams claw through its mind.

A frightened creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

#### Emergency Containment Directive
*4th- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Until dispelled

You etch a binding glyph into the environment, invoking an official A.S.T.R.A.L.- grade spatial lockdown. This containment field is undetectable to the naked eye and can only be revealed by corporate- grade anomaly scanners.

- When a creature first enters the affected space (a 10- foot radius circle centered on the glyph), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become contained within the bureaucratic lockdown.
- A contained creature is mentally shunted into an abstract “waiting room” within the anomaly filing system. While aware of their surroundings, they cannot move, act, or communicate unless presented with a notarized authorization sigil, which is magically created at the time of casting and bound to the spellcaster or a designated entity.
- Creatures that successfully save are unaffected and may pass through freely, but the glyph remains until dispelled or triggered.
- Once triggered, the glyph can no longer detain other creatures.

---



#### Escalate to Management
*4th- level Enchantment*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 hours

Target one humanoid. They must make a Wisdom saving throw or become convinced that their current issue is “not their problem” and must be escalated to a higher authority. They will refuse to engage further until a superior intervenes.

- On a failure, they gain the Paranoid condition and become convinced that their current task or conflict is “not their jurisdiction.” 
- While Paranoid in this way, they will actively avoid confrontation, refuse to complete objectives, and demand the presence of a superior or authoritative figure.
- In combat, they will take the Dodge action unless directly attacked, and will spend their turns muttering about policy violations or escalation procedures. 
- They may only repeat the saving throw at the end of each hour, or when confronted by a creature they recognize as a superior.

On a successful save, the target shrugs off the compulsion, but suffers disadvantage on their next ability check or attack roll as lingering doubt creeps in.

**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 hours

You cast out a burst of twisted awareness—the echo of something watching, something ancient and analytical. The air in the chosen area distorts, revealing the ghostly attention trails of an otherworldly intelligence.

All creatures of your choice within a 30- foot- radius sphere centered on a point within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they suffer the effects listed below:

On a success, the creature is unaffected, but leaves behind a faint trail visible only to you, allowing you to track them regardless of stealth or invisibility.

*4th- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: 10 minutes

You establish an emergency extraction point for a willing target. At any moment, the target may activate the extraction, teleporting instantly to a predetermined safe location within 1 mile.

You unleash a concentrated beam of unstable, pyric energy in a 5- foot- wide, 60- foot- long line.

- Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 6d8 pyric damage, or half as much on a success. 
- The beam burns a visible scar of irradiated energy across every surface it touches.

Radiation Effect: 
For as long as you maintain concentration, the scorched path emits low- level radiation:
- Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the irradiated scar takes 1d4 radiation damage. 
- If a creature receives any healing, magical or mundane, this damage no longer affects them unless they re- enter the area after being healed.

**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 8 hours

- The 15- foot- diameter space is soundproof, protected from weather, and forbiddingly private.
- The caster can shape the interior at will, conjuring cushions, incense, and music that hums from the walls themselves.
- Those who rest inside awaken feeling like time itself curled around them, leaving them untouched.

#### Refraction of Self
*4th- level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Bonus Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes

Your form fractures slightly from this world, your outline flickering and bending at unnatural angles. When injured, reality itself offers you an escape—but not always a reliable one.

While this spell is active, each time you take damage, you may immediately teleport up to 20 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. This reaction does not cost an action or reaction.

You must have line of sight to teleport intentionally. If no valid space exists, the teleportation fails.

While this spell is active, you cast no reflection on reflective surfaces

---



#### Residual Presence
*4th- level Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 hours

You reach beyond the veil and call forth a flickering echo of a recently deceased creature. Instead of communicating directly, you witness fractured memories or emotional imprints they left behind.

When cast on a space where a humanoid died within the last 7 days, choose one of the following effects:

- Residual Vision. You and up to 5 willing creatures see a ghostly reenactment of the creature’s final moments, projected like a spectral recording. The scene is silent and incomplete, but may reveal useful visual details such as a killer's face, a hidden object, or a symbol drawn in blood.
 
- Lingering Instinct. You gain a skill or tool proficiency the deceased possessed (your choice, if known) for 10 minutes. You also gain advantage on Intelligence checks related to the creature's past profession or knowledge.

- Emotional Imprint. The space is saturated with the creature's strongest emotion at the time of death. For 10 minutes, anyone entering the space must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or experience that emotion intensely (e.g., rage, fear, sorrow), which may affect social interactions, Insight, or Intimidation checks.

The echo fades once the chosen effect ends, or if dismissed early.

#### Rotating Opus of Indignation
*4th- level Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Reaction
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: S
**Duration:**     :: 1 rounds

As your mind cracks under pressure, you unleash an anomalous pulse of rhythm and defiance—a stuttering cosmic melody that replays itself, over and over, across the battlefield. The air pulses in time with an unseen waltz. Reality blinks.

When you fail a saving throw, you may cast this spell to release a psychic backlash in a 20- foot radius centered on a point you choose within range.

Each creature in the area must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they take 4d8 chiaric damage, and are staggered, unable to take reactions until the start of their next turn. On a success, they take half damage and suffer no additional effect.

Once per round for the duration (1 round), the melody echoes faintly again at initiative count 0. Creatures that failed their original save feel a tremor of déjà vu and take 1 cognitive damage as the rhythm loops.

---

*4th- level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You attempt to forcibly disconnect a supernatural entity from the material world. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it loses its ethereal, invisible, or extraplanar traits for the duration. If it was bound to this plane via an anomaly, it must roll a d6 each round—on a 1, it is banished permanently.

---

#### Sleep Theft
*4th- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Special
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: S
**Duration:**     :: Special

In the intimacy of flesh and fevered breath, the caster siphons the essence of slumber from their partner.

- After a shared act of passion, the target falls into an unnatural sleep for 1 hour per caster level.
- The caster awakens fully refreshed, as if they had slept those stolen hours.
- If the spell is cast repeatedly on the same victim, their dreams begin to fray, unraveling into visions of things best left unseen.
- If the target is asleep or unconscious, they automatically fail the saving throw against this spell.
- Some say the most powerful users of this spell never sleep at all, stealing rest from a hundred lovers.

---



#### Step Between Forms
*4th- level Illusion*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You blur at the edges, your body slipping into the seams of unreality. Shadows cling to you unnaturally, muting your presence, your weight, your warmth. You become a half- whisper in the world of form.

While the spell is active:- You gain resistance to all damage except chiaric and cognitive.- You cannot physically interact with creatures or objects (you pass through doors but cannot open them; you cannot attack or cast spells requiring material components).- You are considered heavily obscured to creatures relying on normal sight and invisible in dim light or darkness.- You can move through non- magical objects and walls as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 void damage if you end your turn inside a solid object.

---



#### Subsurface Surge
*4th- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 90 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You rupture the terrain beneath your enemies. Choose a 30- foot cube of ground composed of urban or industrial material—concrete, asphalt, or metal. The area fractures and collapses, causing all creatures in the zone to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a fail, they take 6d8 bludgeoning damage and fall prone. On success, they take half damage and remain standing.
- Structures in the area take maximum damage and may collapse at DM discretion.
- Difficult terrain remains in the area until cleared.

---



#### Analog Waves
*4th- level Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You summon a storm of distorted analog signals, corrupted waveforms, and audio screeches that flood the minds of all creatures in a 10- foot- radius sphere centered on a point within range. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 5d8 sound damage and is stunned until the start of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half damage and is not stunned.

---



#### Surveillance Blackout
*4th- level Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes

You create an anomalous interference field that disrupts all surveillance and recording devices within range.
- Security cameras, sensors, and microphones malfunction, either looping old footage, displaying static, or going completely dark.
- Magical scrying attempts have disadvantage, as their feed becomes distorted and unreliable.
- Observers viewing the affected area remotely must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to recall what they saw.
 

 This spell does not grant invisibility but renders technological and magical observation highly unreliable.

---



#### Thallan's Flecks of Repugnant Soap
*4th- level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You cast a handful of impossibly dry, crumbling soap into the air. It dissolves mid- flight, releasing microscopic flecks of cleansing hatred that scour body, soul, and shame alike.

Each creature in a 20- foot- radius sphere centered on you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 11d4 biologic damage as the soap sears away impurities—real or imagined—with unrelenting force. On a successful save, they take half damage.
- Affected creatures are coated in a stinging residue for 1 minute. During this time, they emit a foul, antiseptic stench, suffer disadvantage on Charisma checks, and cannot benefit from healing spells unless they succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the start of their turn.
- Creatures without skin (undead, constructs, oozes) are immune to this spell.

---



#### Thallan's Hand of Craven Opal
*4th- level Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, R
**Duration:**     :: concentration

You call upon the maddening echoes of the Craven Opal, forcing the minds of your enemies to grasp fragments of truths too vast to bear. Choose up to three creatures within range. Each must make an Intelligence saving throw.
- On a failure, a creature takes 5d8 cognitive damage and has(disadvantage on Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws) until the end of its next turn.
- On a success, it takes half damage and suffers no other effect.

While concentrating on this spell, you may use your action on subsequent turns to target the same or different creatures within range (up to three again). Each new wave of insight echoes the original effect—forcing a new save, new damage.

---



#### The Crawling Hunger
*4th- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Permanent (until satiated)

You place a consuming need inside a creature, but it is not hunger for food—it is for something worse.
 
- The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they develop an insatiable hunger for a specific, forbidden thing, chosen randomly from the list below:
 
- The hunger cannot be resisted forever—every 24 hours without consuming the object, they take 2d6 cognitive damage.
- If they give in, they feel no satisfaction, only greater hunger.

---



#### The Infinite Stare
*4th- level Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes

Your eyes become vessels of an unknowable force—an unblinking, paradoxical void that reflects nothing and sees everything. You focus this unnatural stare on a single creature within range.

The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or become Obsessed with your gaze. While obsessed, the creature:
- Cannot avert its eyes from you and cannot willingly move more than 30 feet away.
- Suffers disadvantage on Wisdom and Intelligence checks and saving throws as its thoughts loop in recursive terror.
- Takes 2d6 cognitive damage at the start of each of its turns as your gaze frays its mental barriers.

The creature may attempt another saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the effect ends.

---



#### The Ticking Man’s Favor
*4th- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: 1 minutes
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 24 hours

You grant a creature the blessing of the Ticking Man, a timeless entity whose debts must always be paid.
 

- The target gains +1 to AC and saving throws while the spell is active.
- At any time within 24 hours, the Ticking Man may call in the favor, forcing the target to perform one action or request, no matter the cost.
- If the request is refused, the target immediately ages 2d20 years and loses the benefits of the spell.

---



#### Urban Verdancy
*4th- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: up to 10 minutes

You summon aggressive plant life adapted to industrial ruin—twisting vines, mosses, and rust- coated thorns that erupt from the concrete. The area becomes difficult terrain for all creatures. When a creature starts its turn there, they must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by overgrowth until the start of their next turn.
- You can spend your bonus action to move the overgrowth 10 feet along a surface (wall or floor).
- Constructs and inorganic creatures make the save with disadvantage.

---



#### Yarol's Veil
*4th- level Illusion*
**Casting Time:** :: 1 minutes
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: up to 1 minutes

You wrap yourself in the forgotten script of Yarol, creating a mobile sphere of veiled perception. For the duration, all creatures of your choice within a 30- foot radius of you become invisible. The area of effect moves with you, but the spell ends early if you move faster than half your speed, cast a spell, or make an attack.

Objects not held or worn remain visible, even if within the veil. Items carried by invisible creatures vanish along with them. Light, sound, and scent still pass through the veil—this is not silence, only obfuscation.

Creatures under this effect become heavily obscured to others, but not to one another—those within can still see each other clearly, as if the veil exists only to conceal them from the outside world.

---



#### A.S.T.R.A.L. Redaction
*5th- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: 10 minutes
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Permanent

You purge all traces of a target from bureaucratic and digital records, making it appear as though they never existed.
 
- All legal, corporate, and governmental archives remove mentions of the target.
- Anyone attempting to recall or reference the target must make a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw, or they recall only vague, contradictory memories.
- If the target is alive, they are now considered a "non- entity"—unable to be tracked, processed, or employed legally.

---



#### Artificial Synchronicity
*5th- level Enchantment*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes

You bind the nervous rhythms of two willing creatures into perfect alignment, creating a temporary harmonic feedback loop between their minds and bodies. While within 10 feet of each other, the paired creatures experience the following effects:

- Combat Harmony: They gain advantage on all attack rolls made while near each other. 
- Cognitive Buffering: They both gain resistance to cognitive damage. 
- Synaptic Link: They can communicate telepathically for the duration. 
- Reactive Dissonance: When one takes damage, the other may use their reaction to absorb half of it, splitting the harm across both bodies.

The link feels like an artificial heartbeat humming between them—steady, precise, and faintly electric. If either target becomes unwilling or unconscious, the spell ends immediately.

---



#### Atomic Sting
*5th- level Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Up to 1 minutes

You jab the target with a concentrated arc of mutagenic force—an invisible sting of unstable energy. On contact, the target suffers 6d10 radiation damage and becomes contaminated for the duration. A faint, glowing scar in the shape of a barbed sting appears where they were struck.

While contaminated:
- The target emits low- level radiation in a 5- foot radius.
- Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the target (excluding you) takes 1d6 radiation damage.
- The target takes 1d4 radiation damage at the start of each of their turns as their body fails to contain the energy.
- The contamination spreads: Any creature that ends its turn grappling or touching the target also becomes contaminated until the spell ends.

If the affected target receives any magical healing, the contamination ends for them, but the sting scar remains unless removed by Arcane Sterilization or Sigil of Restoration.

---



#### Chrono- Administrative Delay
*5th- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You delay the effects of an action, spell, or attack by one round. The affected action still happens, but only after a bureaucratically determined amount of time has passed—enemies and allies alike feel the weight of red tape preventing immediate resolution.

---



#### Ciphered Message
*5th- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: 10 minutes
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Until received or destroyed

You encrypt a message into a magical cipher, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read or hear it. Any unauthorized entity attempting to intercept the message sees random gibberish or hears static interference.
 
The recipient receives the message via a paranormal medium (a flickering holoscreen, whispered transmission, or ghostly text). If the message is not received within 7 days, it self- destructs.

---



#### Classified Information Leak
*5th- level Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You unseal a forgotten corporate secret so damning it collapses reality around a target.

Choose one creature within range. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or suffer the following effects:

- Take 6d10 cognitive damage as the weight of hidden knowledge ruptures their thoughts. 
- For 1 minute, the target suffers disadvantage on Intelligence and Charisma checks as their mind reels from the implications. 

On a successful save, the target takes half damage and suffers no further effect.

---



#### Corporate Bureaucratic Delay
*5th- level Enchantment*
**Casting Time:** :: Reaction
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 rounds

With a weaponized application of administrative inefficiency, you impose a mandatory review process on your target, delaying their next action by one full round.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure:
 
- Their action does not occur until the start of their next turn.
- If they attempt to resist the delay, they must spend their bonus action and reaction attempting to "process" the action instead of completing it.
- If the spell is countered by a corporate- affiliated caster, both casters must roll competing Intelligence checks to determine whose bureaucratic force wins out.

Additional Effect: If cast against an entity that operates under strict corporate, military, or legal structures, they suffer disadvantage on the save.

---



#### Corporate Detox Protocol
*5th- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 24 hours

The target is insured against death for the next 24 hours. If they die, they are immediately revived with half their maximum hit points, but they owe a significant favor to the entity that funded their return.

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 hours

The soul of a recently deceased creature is uploaded into a technological system instead of passing on. Their essence lingers in the digital realm, allowing them to communicate, interact with data, and haunt technology within the range.

---



#### Echoes of the Forgotten
*5th- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You fracture the veil of memory and call forth the voices of the long- dead—those whose names were erased, whose deaths were forgotten. In a 20- foot- radius sphere centered on a point within range, spectral murmurs begin to rise, growing louder until they echo with unbearable presence.

Each creature in the area must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they are frightened and deafened for the duration. While frightened in this way, they perceive haunting whispers describing their worst regrets, lost memories, or alternate lives that could have been.

A creature that ends its turn in the area must repeat the saving throw.

---



#### Existential Debt
*5th- level Enchantment*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 hours

You impose an unavoidable debt upon the target, compelling them to fulfill an obligation tied to their very being.
 
 The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure:
 
- They become existentially bound to the caster, compelled to follow one command that does not directly endanger their life.
- If they resist the obligation, they suffer 2d10 cognitive damage at the start of each of their turns.
- If the target dies while under this spell, their soul is held in escrow, awaiting transfer.
 
 The debt can be transferred to another willing entity via a ritual requiring 10 minutes and a secondary Charisma saving throw.

---



#### Fleshsmith’s Alloy
*5th- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: 1 hours
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Permanent

You heat iron, steel, or bone, mixing it with living flesh, forging them together into a hybrid alloy that feels both warm and cold to the touch.
 
- This does not create a living creature—it creates an object that remembers pain, warmth, and hunger.
- Flesh- infused metal moves slightly when held, adjusting to its wielder’s grip.
- If used in armor, it twitches and flexes on impact, slightly reducing damage.
- If used in a weapon, it drinks the blood it spills, remaining polished even after battle.
- If destroyed, the material screams.

---



#### Paranormal Expense Report
*5th- level Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You force a creature to justify their existence within this reality. The target must make a Charisma saving throw or be rendered immaterial for 1 minute, unable to interact with the world. If they are native to this reality, they roll with advantage.

---



#### Permanent Record
*5th- level Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Permanent

You extract the complete metaphysical profile of a target creature—its memories, choices, emotional imprints, and karmic residue—manifesting as an encoded construct known as a Permanent Record. The target must be willing, restrained, unconscious, or under a compulsion effect.

Once extracted, the record can be:
- Uploaded to an A.S.T.R.A.L. database, where it becomes permanently trackable across dimensions and planar boundaries.
- Altered with a successful Intelligence (Forgery) check (DC = 10 + target’s level or CR), allowing you to rewrite elements of their identity (alignment, history, public record, or even magical marks).
- Obscured, making the target immune to divination and tracking effects (e.g., Bullet Trace, Automated Surveillance, Permanent Record) for 7 days. Only Greater Restoration, Wish, or a successful Remove Curse cast at 6th level can reverse the obfuscation.

A creature whose record is altered becomes Altered until restored. Spells that rely on identity or consent may behave unpredictably.

---



#### Rapid Reload
*5th- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Bonus Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 9 rounds

*5th- level Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You rupture local reality, creating a 20- foot sphere of spatial instability. At the start of each creature’s turn inside the zone, they must make a Constitution saving throw or take 4d10 impact damage as their bodies struggle to remain cohesive.

**Range:**        :: Self (10- feet radius)
**Components:**   :: V, S, R

You project a metaphysical failsafe that prevents involuntary memory alteration and data corruption within a 10- foot radius sphere.

- Any attempt to erase, fragment, or overwrite memories in this area automatically fails.
- Spells like Memory Fragmentation, Compliance Protocol, and A.S.T.R.A.L. Redaction are nullified within the field.
- Digital and paper records within the field are temporarily immune to deletion by magical or technological means.

---



#### Reversed Gravity Bubble
*5th- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You create a shimmering sphere of warped gravitational pull, 10 feet in radius, centered on a point within range. Within this bubble, gravity reverses erratically, pulling objects and creatures toward the ceiling, sideways, or suspending them in a nauseating spin.

Effects on Casting:- All creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw.- On a failure, a creature is flung 20 feet straight upward, taking fall damage (2d6) upon descent unless they can catch themselves or land safely.- On a success, the creature manages to stabilize but still floats awkwardly, suffering disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks until they exit the area.

Ongoing Effects (Each Round):

At the start of each of your turns while concentration is maintained:- Roll a d4 to determine the gravitational direction.

Creatures that remain in the area suffer mild disorientation and have disadvantage on ranged attacks and Dexterity saving throws while inside the sphere.

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet (10- feet radius)
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

A field of energy disrupts magic and technology. Any spells of 5th level or lower automatically fail, and creatures with cybernetic implants or magic item attunements must make a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the start of their next turn.

---



#### Spectral Retraction
*5th- level Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 90 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You invoke an invisible tether of force that violently pulls a creature backward through the path it came.

Choose one creature within range. That target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be dragged up to 30 feet in a straight line toward the space it occupied at the start of its previous turn.

- If the target collides with a solid object or creature during this forced movement, it takes 6d12 void damage, and the object or creature it struck takes half as much.
- On a successful save, the target is not moved, but still takes half damage from the forceful retraction.

---



#### System Breach
*5th- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You rewrite the physical properties of a surface to grant temporary, anomalous passage.

- Choose a solid non- magical wall, vault, or reinforced surface no more than 5 feet thick. You create a 10- foot long, 5- foot wide tunnel that reshapes the material around you.
- The tunnel is semi- translucent, shimmering with glitching static and rippling light.
- The tunnel closes behind you after 1 round unless you maintain concentration, in which case it persists for the spell's duration.
- The tunnel cannot be created through living creatures or organic matter.

Warded or Magical Surfaces: 
If the surface is protected by magical wards or is made of enchanted material, make an Arcana check (DC = 10 + spell level of the warding effect). On a failure, the spell fizzles harmlessly, and your spell slot is not expended.

---



#### Thallan's Consuming Lance
*5th- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 120 feet
**Components:**   :: S
**Duration:**     :: up to 1 minutes

You launch a pulse of cursed energy in a straight 120- foot line, lashing through all creatures in its path. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw.

- On a failure, the creature becomes Cursed by the Lance for the duration and takes 2d8 chiaric damage. 
- On a success, the creature takes half damage and is not cursed.

While Cursed by the Lance:
- If the creature dies, its body detonates in a burst of radiant decay, dealing 2d6 chiaric damage to all creatures within 10 feet.
- Any creature killed by this explosion while also under the curse triggers a new detonation, potentially chaining across the battlefield.
- Cursed creatures emit a faint hum of inverted sound, and their veins glow faintly with impossible colors.

---



#### Thaumaturgic Firewall
*5th- level Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes

- Any creature attempting to teleport, phase shift, or enter the area via extradimensional travel must succeed on a Charisma saving throw.
- On a failed save, they are forcibly bounced back to their point of origin and take 4d6 void damage as the firewall briefly stabilizes their reality—violently.
- Creatures that attempt to cross into the firewall without magical travel feel a pressure in the air but suffer no immediate effect unless the area is layered with other wards.
- The firewall emits a low- frequency pulse only detectable to those attuned to arcane signals. To most, it appears as empty space.

You strip power from a target’s true name, making them vulnerable.

- The target has disadvantage on all saving throws against effects that explicitly name them in their casting, inscription, or invocation (such as through a name spoken aloud, signed in a document, or used in a ritual).
- Any creature who speaks the target’s name aloud can sense the direction (not exact location) of the target within 1 mile, provided the target is on the same plane.
- This effect ends if the name is burned, rewritten, legally nullified, or exchanged through sanctioned rites (as negotiated through an A.S.T.R.A.L. broker or similar agent).

#### Unauthorized Spatial Breach
*5th- level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes

You forcefully tear open a 30- foot- wide unstable rift between your location and another point you can see within range. This portal remains open for the duration or until your concentration is broken.

- Any creature may step through the rift as a movement action, arriving instantly at the destination point.
- Creatures must return through the same rift before the spell ends. If they do not, they are trapped between unstable dimensional layers.

> While trapped:
- Affected creatures cannot be targeted, located, or communicated with by any means.
- After 1d6 hours, they are forcibly ejected into the nearest safe, unoccupied space near the original destination.
- Upon return, they suffer 3d10 distortive damage from temporal and spatial disorientation.

If the caster ends the spell voluntarily or is incapacitated, the rift collapses immediately.

**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Permanent (until the anomaly resolves itself)

You whisper an incantation not meant for mortal tongues, invoking the presence of something that waits between fate and flesh. The spell rewrites the biological continuity of the target’s reproductive essence, severing it from natural law and entangling it with the unknown.
 
- Upon casting, the target must roll a d6—their fate is dictated by an unseen force:
 
- The change is not immediately noticed—it takes effect subtly, like a whisper embedded in the fabric of their being.
- Any attempt to reverse the effect without understanding it risks creating a secondary anomaly, potentially rewriting the target’s entire genetic structure.

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Up to 1 minutes

#### Power Word: Unravel
*6th- level Enchantment*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You speak a single, forbidden syllable: A sonic anomaly that cuts beneath thought, identity, and social constraint. The moment it leaves your lips, the word spreads like an invisible shockwave, slipping past armor, modesty, and mental fortitude.

Every creature within 60 feet of you who can hear the word, including yourself, must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to immediately strip all worn items, including clothing, armor, uniforms, accessories, magical attire, and identity- linked gear.

Affected creatures drop whatever they are holding and use their next movement and action (if able) to completely disrobe, regardless of current danger, weather, or social context. The compulsion lasts until the creature has removed all items or is incapacitated.

- The caster is not immune.
- Creatures immune to being charmed are unaffected.
- Deafened creatures or those in soundproof areas are unaffected.
- Constructs or creatures that do not wear gear are unaffected.
- If a creature removes magical protective gear, their AC may drop, and spell effects tied to those items end as usual.

Additional Effects

- All illusions, glamers, disguises, and non- permanent magical concealments affecting creatures in range are immediately dispelled, as if targeted by dispel magic.
- Creatures under effects such as disguise self, invisibility, or illusion- based shapeshifting are revealed in their true forms for 1 minute.

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet

Creatures or objects caught underneath when the ship is conjured are gently pushed aside and take no damage.

- The entrance must be non- magical, or you must succeed on a DC 20 Arcana check to bypass magical locks.
- The illusionary gateway remains open for 10 seconds after the first creature steps through, then vanishes.

**Range:**        :: Self (30- feet radius)
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

- Their maximum hit points are reduced by 2d10. This reduction lasts until they complete a long rest. 
- They become Frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

#### A.S.T.R.A.L. Protocol Override
*7th- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Reaction
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

When a creature within 60 feet casts a spell, you interrupt and delay its activation. The targeted spell has no immediate effect. Instead, roll 1d4. After that many rounds have passed (at the beginning of your turn), the delayed spell automatically fails, expending its original caster’s spell slot or resources without taking effect.

During the delay, the original caster is aware the spell is stalled but cannot cancel or change the delayed spell, nor recover the spell slot or resources used. Until the spell fails, it counts as “being cast,” preventing the caster from concentrating on another spell if it required concentration. You may only have one spell delayed by A.S.T.R.A.L. Protocol Override active at a time. If you cast this spell again before the previous delayed spell fails, the original delayed spell immediately resolves as normal (taking effect instantly) instead of failing.

---



#### Alerrim's Solitude
*7th- level Illusion*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Components:**   :: S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You overwhelm the senses of up to six creatures within range with a hallucinated scent so vivid and strange that it threatens their grip on reality. The scent can be chosen by you upon casting and changes the spell’s effect. You may also choose whether the scent feels directional or all- consuming. Affected creatures must make a Constitution saving throw or suffer the selected effect.

At the end of each of their turns, affected creatures must repeat the saving throw. On two failed saves, the target becomes Stunned until the end of their next turn as the olfactory hallucination overwhelms their nervous system.

Choose one scent effect upon casting:

Rot and Filth: Targets that fail their save are Poisoned and suffer disadvantage on saving throws against charm and fear effects for the duration .

Sweet Perfume: Targets must succeed on a Wisdom save or be Charmed by you until the end of that turn.

Burnt Ozone: On a failed save, targets cannot take reactions until the start of their next turn and The creature has disadvantage on Perception and Insight checks.

You may use a bonus action on your turn to change the scent’s directionality (e.g., from everywhere to a specific direction).

The illusion lingers for 1 minute, and affected creatures must repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns. On a success, the effect ends for them.

Condition Synergy: If a target is already Frightened, Charmed, or Poisoned when affected, it has disadvantage on the initial saving throw.

Obscured Battlefield: While under the spell’s effect, affected creatures are considered heavily obscured to others—they constantly shift position in reaction to the scent, creating a surreal mirage- like presence. This effect ends if the scent illusion ends.

Additionally, while the spell is active, you may use an action to cause the scent to mimic a recognizable compound—such as smoke, fuel, or blood—potentially triggering scent- based detection systems or distracting creatures with scent- based senses.

**Duration:**     :: 4d8 + 12 hours

You speak a cursed word in a language not meant for mortals, invoking the forbidden knowledge of Dyrnar’s Doom. Choose one creature within range. The target becomes marked for death. Lines of black sigils appear on the target’s hands and neck, and the target learns that they will die in 4d8 + 12 hours unless certain conditions are met. They know how much time they have and how to avoid the doom:
 1. Curse Removal: The target can make a successful Wisdom saving throw at the end of each day to break the curse.
 2. Kill a Humanoid: The target must kill a humanoid within the time frame to delay the curse. The humanoid must be a creature capable of being killed by the target.

If the conditions are not met, the target dies when the time expires.

The sigils continue to spread as the time runs out, covering the target’s body in dark ink. If the conditions are met or the curse is removed, the sigils vanish, and the target is freed from the impending doom.

Saving Throw: Wisdom save to resist being marked for death.

**Range:**        :: 20 feet
**Components:**   :: S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You lift a wooden coin between two fingers, and for a moment it refracts light like a perfect diamond. Then it cracks—soundlessly—and the world flinches. A prismatic spike of psychic light erupts from your palm, targeting one creature within range.

The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 9d8 chiaric damage, their soul briefly exposed to the void between form and perception. On a success, they take half damage.

While the damage is instant, the wound is not: 
- If the creature survives, their shadow refuses to follow their movements for 1 hour. 
- Affected creatures cannot be healed by magical means until the start of your next turn. 
- If this spell reduces a creature to 0 HP, they vanish silently—no body, no mark, only a lingering echo of their name.
- The target cannot be hidden from magical detection (such as *Ghost Circuit* or *Giocrin’s Hunt*). 
- If they speak, their voice echoes unnaturally, revealing their position to any creature within 60 feet.

For 1 minute after taking damage from this spell, the target becomes crystalline within. Whenever they take radiation, cognitive, or chiaric damage, roll a d4. On a 1, the damage is reflected onto a random creature within 10 feet instead, as internal refractions lash outward unpredictably.

Fracture Point: If the creature is reduced to 0 hit points by this spell, they break into dust- fine crystal, leaving behind only a single perfect diamond worth 100 credit (tainted with residual dread).


At the end of the duration, the crystals dissolve harmlessly, leaving only lingering static in their nervous system.

#### Giocrin's Incantation of Bitterness
*7th- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Premanent (until removed)

You whisper an ancient syllable not meant to be spoken—a fractured word dredged from beneath time itself. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be branded by a lingering metaphysical wound.

- The target becomes vulnerable to either tearing or impact damage (your choice). This vulnerability cannot be removed by ordinary means.
- While affected, any time the target takes damage from the chosen type, they must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.
- If the target reaches 3 levels of exhaustion in this way, the damage type reverberates within their soul: all resistances to that damage type are lost permanently, and they are always considered flanked, even when not surrounded.

The curse is subtle at first. The skin bruises too easily. The bone aches before it breaks. Eventually, even the lightest touch feels like betrayal.

This effect lasts until removed by powerful means such as some spells, or an A.S.T.R.A.L. anomaly purge.

#### Incantation of Viridian Determination
*7th- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self or Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 10 minutes

You invoke a forgotten rite whispered only in the darkest forests of the world’s memory. Verdant energy coils around your body or that of a chosen creature, weaving an invisible knot of resolve that defies mortal limits. This knot pulses with an unnatural green glow, visible only in reflections and peripheral vision.

While under the effects of this spell, the creature gains the following benefits:

- Last Stand Ward: The next time the creature would fall to 0 hit points, they instead regain 3d10 + your spellcasting modifier hit points, immediately stand upright without using movement, and are immune to being reduced to 0 HP again until the end of their next turn. The spell then ends.
- Defiance of Death: Until the ward is triggered, the target cannot gain the *Unconscious* or *Paralysed* conditions. 
- Aura of Persistence: Allies within 10 feet gain advantage on saving throws against effects that would cause *Frightened*, *Paralysed*, or *Charmed*.

If the ward is not triggered within the spell’s duration, the energy fades—leaving behind a faint green sigil burned into the target’s aura, visible only to the dead.

#### Looming Obsidian of Anarchy
*7th- level Illusion*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: S
**Duration:**     :: up to 1 minutes

You conjure a monolithic shard of shadowed obsidian that floats, silent and watching, above the battlefield. Its presence is metaphysical—part hallucination, part intrusion from another plane. All who gaze upon it feel a pressure behind their eyes, as if something ancient is clawing through their thoughts.

Choose up to five creatures within range. Each must make an Intelligence saving throw at the start of each of their turns while the shard persists. On a failed save:

- The creature takes 6d6 cognitive damage.
- They suffer disadvantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks until the end of their next turn.
- If they fail by 5 or more, they also gain the Paranoid condition until the end of the spell.

On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and suffers no other effects that round.

The Obsidian Effect: 
At the end of each of your turns, the shard lashes out at a random creature of your choice within range that has already failed a saving throw this round. That creature immediately takes an additional 3d6 cognitive damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of their next turn.

---



#### Mnemonic Fortress
*7th- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: 1 minutes
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 24 hours

You fortify the mind of a creature against forced memory alterations, cognitive tampering, and external data manipulation.
 
- The target becomes immune to Memory Fragmentation, A.S.T.R.A.L. Redaction, and similar effects.
- Any attempt to modify their memory fails outright, and the caster of the effect must make a Wisdom saving throw or suffer 5d8 cognitive damage.
- The target also remembers everything perfectly for 24 hours, with a near- photographic recall of events.

---



#### Obsolescence Protocol
*7th- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You mark a creature as obsolete, and reality enforces the correction. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes 10d10 impact damage and suffers disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks for 1 minute. If the creature has legendary resistances, it must expend one to automatically succeed.

---



#### Plasma Meltdown
*7th- level Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 90 feet (30- feet radius)
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You rupture a paranormal energy grid, causing an unstable plasma explosion that engulfs an area.
 
- Creatures in the blast must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 10d8 impact damage and gain 1 level of Exhaustion from radiation exposure.
- Objects and structures in the area melt or disintegrate as if subjected to high- voltage energy.
- Any spell weaker than 5th level in the area is automatically dispelled.

---



#### Reality Sidestep
*7th- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Until dispelled

You exist half inside reality, half outside of it. While active:
- You can pass through walls and barriers as long as they are not magical.
- You gain resistance to all physical damage.
- You leave behind a blurred, static afterimage that lingers for 6 seconds before catching up.

---



#### Reality Stabilization Directive
*7th- level Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You impose order upon unstable reality, restoring creatures to their natural state before corruption, conditioning, or anomaly influence.
 
- Removes all magical or corporate mind control, forced allegiance effects, and reality distortions affecting the target.
- Fully cures madness, paranoia, and supernatural trauma.
- If the target is possessed, controlled, or overwritten, the controlling entity must make a Charisma saving throw or be ejected instantly.

---



#### Rebuild Reality
*7th- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You restore a destroyed or corrupted location (up to 1,000 square feet) to a prior state. This includes buildings, roads, and technological structures—but not living creatures. The restored state must have existed within the last 100 years, and anomalies within the area may resist reconstruction.

---



#### Reconstructive Audit
*7th- level Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

The target’s body is reconstructed, restoring all hit points and replacing any lost limbs or organs. If the target was subject to severe mutation or anomalous corruption, the spell attempts to restore their original form.

---



#### Skin Unwoven
*7th- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You weave an invisible suture in the air, connecting it to the target’s flesh and nerves. The thread does not cut, it unravels, pulling the skin away in delicate layers.

- The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, their flesh begins to separate from their body, piece by piece.
- Round 1: Their fingertips and lips begin to curl and peel, exposing raw flesh.
- Round 2: The skin along their arms and jaw pulls loose, hanging like discarded parchment.
- Round 3: Their entire face and chest are stripped, leaving only muscle and exposed nerves.

- The target takes 4d10 chiaric damage per round and suffers disadvantage on all Dexterity- based actions due to agony.
- If the spell lasts the full minute, the target is left entirely skinless, a raw, quivering thing, forced to exist in constant, unbearable sensation.

Skinless Condition: 
- The creature has disadvantage on all saving throws against pain, stun, or fear effects. 
- They are vulnerable to pyric and radiation damage. 
- They cannot benefit from healing spells other than *Reconstructive Audit* or *First Responder Algorithm* until ritually treated. 
- They are permanently disfigured, unless magically or surgically restored. 

End of the Spell: 
- The target may repeat the Constitution save at the end of each of their turns. On a success, the unweaving halts but does not reverse—what has been lost remains lost. 
- If the spell is cast multiple times on the same target, their skin may begin to regrow incorrectly, forming anomalous grafts that twitch and whisper in forgotten tongues.

---



#### System Reboot
*7th- level Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You reset the target’s physical and mental state. They remove all levels of exhaustion, regain 50 hit points, and end one curse, disease, or madness. However, they forget the last hour of their memories.

---



#### Thallan's Saffron Truth
*7th- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Self
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You conjure an arcane seal of forgotten syllables—a 15- foot- radius circle inscribed with runes that shimmer like powdered saffron. The circle centers on you and moves with you. For the duration:

- Allied creatures within the circle gain a +5 bonus to damage on all weapon and spell attacks targeting enemies outside the circle. This damage is impact type and manifests as reverberating glyphs striking in tandem with the blow. 
- If this spell was cast using your final remaining spell slot, this bonus increases to +10, and the runes emit a low harmonic tone audible only to allies. 
- Enemies who enter or begin their turn within the circle must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or suffer disadvantage on all melee attacks until the start of their next turn. 
- Any creature affected by a Condition (such as Paranoid, Compelled, or Frightened) takes an additional 1d6 cognitive damage when hit by attacks made from within the circle.

---



#### The Spear of Forgotten Kings
*7th- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You conjure a colossal spectral spear—a jagged relic made from the reigns of long- erased monarchs and the regrets that bound them. The spear surges forward in a straight line up to 120 feet long and 5 feet wide.

All creatures in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 6d10 chiaric damage. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell has its soul torn from memory and imprisoned within a spectral throne—unable to be resurrected or contacted by any means short of a *Wish* or *Sovereign Accord*.

Success: A creature takes half damage and is not affected by the soul imprisonment effect.

While affected by this spell:
- The area traversed by the spear echoes faintly with overlapping royal decrees in unknown tongues. 
- Any creature standing within 10 feet of the line for the next minute suffers disadvantage on Charisma checks, as their voice seems small and forgotten. 
- You may sense the presence of monarchic or noble bloodlines within range for 1 round, as they resonate with the spear’s memory.

---



#### Tortak's Siphon of Haunting Moss
*7th- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: R
**Duration:**     :: up to 1 minutes

You release a parasitic curse woven from the hunger of haunted moss. Choose a point within range. Any number of creatures within a 15- foot- radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw.

On a failed save:
- For the duration, the next 45 hit points of healing the target would receive are stolen. Instead of regaining hit points, you regain that amount instead, and the target receives nothing.
- Each time this transfer occurs, spectral moss visibly spreads along the target’s skin or clothing.
- While affected, targets have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on spells.

On a success:
- The creature is unaffected, but faint lichen- like patterns momentarily crawl across their skin before vanishing.

The spell ends early for a creature when it has had 45 HP of healing siphoned, when it drops to 0 hit points, or if you lose concentration.

---



#### Yarol's Solitude
*7th- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Reaction
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V
**Duration:**     :: 1d3 rounds

As poison takes hold of a creature, you interject a fragment of forgotten transmutation—an ancient algorithm embedded in the bones of the world. The poison twists, sharpens, and magnifies into something far more insidious.

When a creature within range becomes poisoned, you may use your reaction to invoke Yarol’s Solitude. That creature must make a Constitution saving throw.

- On a failure, the poison mutates into a paralytic toxin. The creature becomes paralyzed for 1d3 rounds, instead of poisoned. Their body stiffens in place, overwhelmed by the sudden chemical transformation.
- On a success, the creature resists paralysis, but the altered poison still takes hold. They are slowed for 1d3 rounds, and remain poisoned. While slowed, they cannot take reactions and their movement speed is halved.

---



#### A.S.T.R.A.L. Protocol: Finality
*8th- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet (20- feet- sphere)
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You invoke A.S.T.R.A.L.’s highest authority, temporarily imposing absolute corporate law upon reality.
 
- Creatures within the area must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they are rendered "non- actors" in reality and can take no hostile actions for the duration.
- Magical and anomalous effects cease functioning in the area, including spells, supernatural abilities, and reality distortions.
- Creatures, objects, and spells summoned by external forces are forcibly ejected.

---



#### Anomalous Energy Discharge
*8th- level Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You trigger an uncontrolled anomaly event at a point you choose within range. All creatures in a 20- foot- radius sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 12d10 impact damage and are thrown 30 feet away. On a success, they take half damage and are not pushed.
 
 The environment is warped by this discharge, causing random gravitational shifts and distorted colors in the area for 1 minute.

---



#### Bloom Canker
*8th- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 120 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: up to 1 minutes

You rupture the boundaries of cell cohesion in a targeted area, causing violent outgrowths of alien flesh and rapid, cancerous mutation.
All creatures in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure:
- They take 8d10 biologic damage.
- They are Mutated for the duration.
- Difficult terrain forms as cancerous masses spread across the ground.

On a success, creatures take half damage and are not mutated.

If cast in an urban area, strange organic material fuses with infrastructure, leaving behind semi- living architecture.

---

*8th- level Enchantment*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: up to 1 minutes

You enforce a miraculous ceasefire between all present minds. Creatures of your choice within range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be overcome with a temporary wave of shared understanding and empathy.
- Affected creatures cannot attack, cast harmful spells, or willingly cause damage.
- They may still speak, act, or flee. If harmed by an external source, they may re- attempt the save at the end of their turn.
- Creatures under this spell see brief flashes of each other’s memories, chosen by the GM.

---



#### Contractual Paradox
*8th- level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: 1 minutes
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Permanent

You trap a creature in a recursive bureaucratic loop, forcing them to relive the same procedural nightmare indefinitely. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to act for 1d10 days, believing themselves stuck in an endless cycle of paperwork, hearings, and bureaucratic review.

---



#### Divine Audit of Worth
*8th- level Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: up to 1 minutes

You cast judgment not as punishment, but to clarify value. Up to six creatures of your choice gain the following benefits:
- Advantage on saving throws against fear, charm, and coercion.
- Once per round, when they miss an attack or fail a check, they may add 1d10 to the result.
- If they would drop to 0 HP, they instead drop to 1 and become immune to death until the start of their next turn.

---



#### Final Seal of Denial
*8th- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: up to 1 minutes

You lock a creature’s existence behind bureaucratic impossibility, stamping them out of authorized reality.

Choose one creature within range. Until the spell ends:
- It is immune to beneficial spells and healing effects.
- It cannot be resurrected or revived while under the effect.
- If it dies while the spell is active, no remains are left, and it is considered non- recoverable by any means short of a 9th- level anomaly correction.

---



#### Flesh to Paper
*8th- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Permanent

Something unknown has touched this magic, leaving behind traces of those who have cast it before.

Before the disaster at Hollowwatch, scribes documented the sudden, inexplicable disappearance of a scholar who had been researching Flesh to Paper. The books on his desk were found neatly stacked, except for one—a tome that had no title, and no pages inside.

Ancient tablets unearthed beneath the ruins of Gilded Hollow show early inscriptions of Flesh to Paper, yet none can determine the language it was written in. The characters shift when no one is looking.

You rewrite a creature’s very being. They must make a Constitution saving throw or be transformed into a parchment scroll, trapped in written form until the scroll is burned.

---



#### Fragmentation Rift
*8th- level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 150 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You summon a dimensional rift in an unoccupied space you can see. Any creature within 20 feet of the rift must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 14d10 impact damage as the very fabric of reality slices through them. On a success, they take half damage.
 
 Any creature reduced to 0 HP by this spell is torn from reality, their fate unknown. The rift collapses at the end of your next turn.

---



#### Kiss of the Nereid
*8th- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: S
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

The caster places a kiss upon the target’s lips, feeling their breath flutter like candlelight in the abyss.
 
- The target must make a Constitution saving throw (- 2 penalty). On a failure, they drown instantly, as if submerged in unseen waters.
- Those who survive describe a vision of something immense, watching from beneath the surface.
- Those who fail leave behind no corpse, only a damp outline where they once stood.

 Some whisper that victims of this spell are not truly dead, but merely waiting… elsewhere.

---



#### Living Archive Conversion
*8th- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: up to 10 minutes

You forcibly transcribe a creature’s memories, emotions, and essence into a self- sustaining organic record. The flesh remembers, even when the mind forgets.

Choose one creature you can see. It must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure:
- It becomes Incapacitated as its senses are hijacked by the recording process.
- For the duration, it speaks aloud its own memories in distorted, overlapping phrases.
- You can ask up to 3 questions, which the creature will answer truthfully—but often abstractly, as its mind is partially unspooled.

If the creature is killed during the effect, its body transforms into an autonomous fleshy codex. The codex:
- Contains full recollections of its life.
- Can be read with an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 17).
- May leak emotional residue to those nearby.

---



#### Man ↔ Cock
*8th- level Transmutation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: up to 10 minutes (or until dispelled)

You perform a questionable and extremely localized reality shift, transforming a humanoid creature into a very aggressive rooster (or vice versa).
- If the target is willing, the transformation is automatic and lasts for the duration or until reversed.
- If the target is unwilling, they must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be transformed for the spell’s duration. They may repeat the save at the end of each of their turns.
- If the caster uses a Vitality and a Unique Offering blood pact the transformation becomes permanent unless reversed with Greater Restoration, Remove Curse, or Wish.
- A rooster (or chicken) transformed into a humanoid is always willing, if inexplicably smug about it.

Forms:
- A humanoid becomes a rooster (tiny beast, 1 HP, peck attack, high aggression, prone to crowing loudly).
- A rooster becomes a humanoid of the caster’s choice, with basic clothing and no memory of being a bird (but with lingering sass).

Reversing the Spell:
The caster may end the spell early as an action. Recasting the spell on the same target (while transformed) reverts them.

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 120 feet (40- feet- radius explosion)

**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they flicker between states of existence, giving all attacks against them advantage while they suffer disadvantage on all actions. They must re- roll all saving throws twice and take the worst result.

---



#### Reality Fracture
*8th- level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet (20- feet radius)
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You create a glitch in reality, causing multiple overlapping timelines to unfold at once.
 
- Creatures in the area must make an Intelligence saving throw.
- On a failure: They suffer 6d12 cognitive damage, as their mind struggles to process fractured existence.
- On a success: They take half damage and experience sensory distortion, giving them disadvantage on all attacks and saves for 1 round.
 
- Each round, a random anomaly occurs:
- 1- 2: The area repeats itself, duplicating any actions that happened in the previous round.
- 3- 4: The terrain briefly vanishes, exposing raw void, causing creatures to fall before space reforms.
- 5- 6: Time accelerates or slows, making movement speeds randomly double or halve.

---



#### Reality Quarantine
*8th- level Conjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 120 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 hours per caster level

You seal an area within a 60- foot radius in a paranormal quarantine field, cutting it off from reality. While inside, creatures cannot enter or exit via teleportation, portals, or extradimensional travel. The barrier is invisible, but all attempts to perceive or interact with the area from outside automatically fail.
- Extremely powerful creatures (CR 20+) or anomalies may attempt a Charisma saving throw once per hour to destabilize the field.

---



#### Seam Ripper of the Living World

**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 120 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: up to 1 minutes

Reality was stitched together for convenience. You simply choose to pull at the thread.
You target a location within range and unravel the physical rules governing that terrain. For the duration, the area becomes Sutured Terrain:

- Matter Becomes Pliable – Stone flows like fabric. Walls bulge and flex. Ground can ripple like water underfoot. All movement is halved unless the creature succeeds a Strength saving throw at the start of its turn.
- Gravity Buckles – Gravity shifts every round. Roll 1d4:

Objects Drift Apart – Doors fall off frames. Windows become free- floating. Anchored structures must pass a DC 18 Constitution saving throw each round or begin to unravel into ambient material.
- Creatures Warped by Terrain – At the end of each round, any creature in the area must succeed a Constitution saving throw or gain a random minor mutation (DM’s discretion). Mutations last until the end of their next long rest.

**Casting Time:** :: 1 hours
**Range:**        :: 1 mile

You invite a spirit back into the world of the living, but only for a limited time.

---



#### Existence Audit
*9th- level Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: 1 minutes
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Permanent

The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they are retroactively erased from history—no records, memories, or traces of their existence remain. Their equipment, celebrityl effects, and any impacts they made on reality remain, but they are gone from time itself.

---



#### Existence Redacted
*9th- level Abjuration*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 30 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You invoke an ultimate bureaucratic decree, striking a being from the known fabric of reality. Choose one creature within range. It must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it takes 20d12 impact damage, and its name, face, and presence are erased from all documents and memories of those who fail a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw.
 
 On a success, it takes half damage and remains in existence.

---



#### Final Expense Reimbursement
*9th- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You restore one creature to life, no matter how long they’ve been dead, provided a contract with a binding entity exists to authorize their return. If no contract exists, the spell fails.

---



#### Heartbreaker
*9th- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 10 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S
**Duration:**     :: Permanent

You speak a single phrase—a word whispered directly into the soul. The target alone hears it. A secret so unbearable, so cosmically cruel, that their body betrays them in its attempt to cope.- The target must make a Constitution saving throw.- On a failure, their heart seizes violently, and they instantly die. Their body remains intact, but their life cannot be restored by any means short of a Wish.- On a success, the target is left paralyzed for 1d6 + 6 weeks, gasping and broken. They cannot take actions, move, or speak for the duration.- Regardless of outcome, the target permanently suffers –1 Strength and –1 Constitution.

---



#### Manifest Anomalous Cataclysm
*9th- level Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 300 feet (1- mile- radius event)
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 24 hours

You awaken a dormant anomaly, unleashing an event- scale paranormal disaster.

- Reality in the area distorts, causing gravity fluctuations, spatial rifts, and shifting architecture.
- Anomalous creatures and hazards begin manifesting, acting unpredictably.
- Any spell cast within the zone has a 50% chance of unexpected effects.

---



#### Mirabel's Final Verse
*9th- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: S, R
**Duration:**     :: Permanent until cured

You press a lingering, soul- bound kiss onto the target—searing an immortal affliction into their very being. The kiss binds them not to life, but to endless suffering.
- The target contracts a disease or madness of your choice (DM discretion or chosen from existing rules).
- They cannot die by any means—not from wounds, fire, aging, poison, or deprivation.
- When reduced to 0 hit points, the target falls into a state of paralyzed consciousness: aware, feeling pain, but unable to move or speak.
- They do not regenerate, heal, or lose hit points unless healed or damaged magically.
- Only a Greater Restoration or Cure Disease cast by a Cleric of higher level than the caster can remove the affliction.

---



#### Mutagenic Injection
*9th- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 90 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Up to 1 minutes

You unleash a catastrophic surge of bio- alchemical corruption that destabilizes the target’s physical form on a cellular level.

Choose one creature within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw.

- On a failed save, the target takes 8d10 biologic damage and gains the Mutated condition for the duration. 
- On a successful save, the target takes half damage and is not mutated.

Ending the Mutation: 
The target may repeat the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mutation on a success. If the target drops to 0 hit points while Mutated, its corpse becomes a biological hazard, exuding a 10- foot aura of corruption (DM determines lingering effects).

---



#### Obliteration Memorandum
*9th- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You issue a sanctioned directive that targets the body itself—its fluids, its functions, its very architecture. The spell sends a binding sigil through the bloodstream of one creature within range, turning their own vital systems against them.

The target must make a Constitution saving throw.

- On a failure, their blood ignites with administrative intent, warping to fulfill the directive. They take 10d10 biologic damage, and for the duration, they are affected by Internal Rebellion (see below).
- On a success, the target takes half damage and is not otherwise affected.

Internal Rebellion: 
For the duration of the spell, the creature suffers the following effects:
- Hemorrhagic Pulses: At the start of each of their turns, roll 1d6. On a 1–3, they take 3d6 biologic damage as their blood attempts to exit through eyes, ears, and pores. 
- Command Override: The caster may use a bonus action on their turn to force the target to use half their movement in a direction of the caster’s choosing, as their own muscle tissue spasms against them. 
- Hostile System Rejection: If the target attempts to cast a spell or take a reaction, they must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw or the action fails and they take 2d6 psychic damage.

If this spell reduces a creature to 0 hit points, their body implodes into mist and splinters of bone, leaving behind no remains.

---



#### Total Contamination Event
*9th- level Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 120 feet
**Components:**   :: V, S, R
**Duration:**     :: 1 minutes

You rupture containment protocols in the fabric of the city. All creatures in the affected area take 8d10 radiation damage (CON save for half) and begin to emit unstable pulses.
- Creatures that fail are Contaminated. For 1 minute, any creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of them takes 1d4 radiation damage, stacking per exposure.
- Contaminated targets glow faintly and are unable to benefit from invisibility or stealth.
- Each contaminated target has a 10% chance to develop a unique anomaly (DM choice).

---



#### Vow of Erasure
*9th- level Necromancy*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: Touch
**Components:**   :: S
**Duration:**     :: Permanent

You press your lips to the target’s skin—cheek, brow, hand, or lips. They do not cry out. They do not resist. There is no flash of light, no scream, no struggle.

There is only absence.- A creature with 150 hit points or fewer instantly dies.- After 1d10 rounds, their body crumbles into dust, leaving no corpse, no remains, and no residue.- They cannot be resurrected by any means—not by Wish, True Resurrection, or divine intervention. Their soul is simply gone, erased from all known realms.- Creatures immune to necrotic damage or undeath are not immune to this spell. It bypasses resistance and death saves.

---



#### Thoughtseed
*0-Cantrip Divination*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 60 feet
**Components:**   :: V
**Duration:**     :: Up to 1 minutes

You plant a subtle psychic thread into the mind of a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on an **Intelligence saving throw** or become **Seeded** for the duration.

While Seeded:
- You can hear **surface thoughts** (what they are actively thinking).
- You know the creature’s **emotional state** and any strong **intent** involving you or your allies.
- As a bonus action on your turn, you may:
- Ask the GM one **yes/no question** the creature knows the answer to.
- Whisper a **single word or phrase** into their mind, which they perceive as their own thought.

A creature that succeeds on the save is immune to your Thoughtseed for 24 hours. 
This spell has **no visual or audible effect** and cannot be detected by mundane means.

---



#### Sundersoul
*0-Cantrip Evocation*
**Casting Time:** :: Action
**Range:**        :: 5 feet radius
**Components:**   :: V
**Duration:**     :: Instantaneous

You release a concussive burst of internal instability — the psychic scream of a soul sundered by power.

Each creature of your choice within 5 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take 1d6 cognitive damage and are pushed 5 feet away from you. On a success, they take half damage and are not moved.

The psychic burst has no visible light, but those affected feel an echo of broken memory.
