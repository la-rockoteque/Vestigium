### Under Contract
A creature is magically or bureaucratically bound to an agreement, contract, or supernatural force.;  
- The creature cannot willingly violate the contract unless they succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC varies by effect).  ;
- If the contract is violated, the creature suffers a penalty, such as psychic damage, exhaustion, or forced compliance.  ;
- A creature attempting to escape the contract must provide legal justification, magical authority, or exploit a loophole, requiring a Charisma (Deception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check (DC 15).  ;
- This condition is similar to the Charmed condition, except that it compels specific actions rather than simply altering disposition.;

---

### Under Surveillance
A creature is being actively monitored by an unseen force, such as corporate security, eldritch entities, or an automated oversight system.  ;
- The creature has disadvantage on Stealth checks, as they are being tracked.  ;
- Their location is known to the surveillance entity at all times.  ;
- If the creature attempts to break a monitored rule, they must make a Charisma saving throw (DC 15) or trigger a recorded infraction leading to future consequences.  ;
- If the creature becomes Erased or Unstable, they are removed from surveillance.  ;
- This condition does not restrict actions but makes evasion or secrecy more difficult.  ;

---

### Compelled
A creature has been subtly influenced into following a directive but believes it is acting of its own free will. ;
- The creature rationalizes their compliance instead of resisting.  ;
- If given an order that contradicts their core beliefs, they may attempt a Wisdom saving throw (DC varies by effect).  ;
- If another creature openly questions their actions, the target makes a DC 15 Intelligence (Insight) check to recognize the manipulation.  ;
- If this condition persists for more than 24 hours, the creature’s personality begins to permanently shift to align with the imposed directive.  ;
- This condition is similar to Charmed, but it forces a specific behavioral change instead of improving social interactions.;

---

### Delayed
A creature’s actions require external authorization to proceed.  ;
- When taking an action, the creature must roll a d20:  
  - 11 or higher – The action succeeds.  
  - 10 or lower – The action fails and cannot be attempted again until their next turn.  ;
- If a Watched creature fails this roll, their action is automatically denied by the surveillance entity.  ;
- If the creature attempts the same action multiple times, they must make a Charisma (Deception) check (DC 15) to justify the request.  ;
- A creature that is Erased is not registered in any system, meaning they ignore this condition.  ;
- This condition is similar to Restrained, except it affects actions instead of movement.;

---

### Unstable
A creature’s existence is fluctuating, causing their actions to be unpredictable. ; 
- At the start of each turn, the creature rolls a d4:  
  - 1: They lose their turn, as if momentarily erased.  
  - 2-3: They act normally.  
  - 4: They act twice, as reality overcompensates for lost time. ; 
- If three or more creatures in the same area are Unstable, reality begins to glitch, creating environmental anomalies.  ;
- If the creature is observed closely (Perception DC 15), they appear flickering or slightly out of sync with the world.  ;
- This condition has similarities to Incapacitated, but instead of complete loss of actions, it introduces random instability.  ;


### Erased
A creature is slowly fading from reality—their presence is no longer acknowledged.  ;
- Initially, weak connections fade—their name is harder to recall, documents mentioning them become illegible.;

- The creature cannot be healed, as magic fails to register them as a valid target.  ;
- Any attempt to call for help, persuade, or socially interact automatically fails unless the listener succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence check. ; 
- If this condition lasts for 24 hours, the creature becomes incorporeal, existing as a memory rather than a physical entity.  ;
- The creature may attempt a DC 15 Wisdom save to anchor themselves back into reality if they see themselves in a mirror or hear their own name spoken.  ;
- This condition is similar to Invisible, but instead of being unseen, the creature is simply forgotten.  ;

---

### Altered
A creature’s thoughts, memories, and personality have been forcibly rewritten by external forces.  ;
- The creature forgets a key piece of information, chosen by the GM or spell effect.  ;
- The creature believes a falsehood as absolute truth and cannot be convinced otherwise.  ;
- If another creature challenges their memory, the affected creature must pass a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become hostile toward the challenger. ; 
- If this condition persists for more than 24 hours, the alteration becomes permanent, and the creature must undergo a major psychological event to undo it.;

---

### Displaced
A creature exists in multiple places at once, but only one version is real.;  
- At the start of their turn, they must choose a location within 30 feet—they are now standing there instead of their original position.  ;
- If attacked, they roll a d6:  
  - 1-3: The attack hits their real body.  
  - 4-6: The attack hits an afterimage, causing 1d6 psychic damage instead. ; 
- The creature cannot tell which version of themselves is real unless they succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence check.;

---

### Mutated
A creature’s body refuses to maintain a stable form, changing unpredictably.;
- Each time the creature takes damage, roll a d6:  
  - 1-2: They grow an extra limb, eye, or mouth that functions but feels unnatural.  
  - 3-4: They lose a minor body feature (e.g., fingernails, a nostril, or body hair).  
  - 5-6: Their body becomes semi-fluid, granting resistance to bludgeoning damage but making them vulnerable to slashing damage.;  
- After three mutations, the creature must pass a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or the changes become permanent.;
- After five mutations, the creature ceases to be fully humanoid and must be cured through an anomaly reversal.;

---

### Paranoid
The creature becomes convinced it is being watched, judged, or hunted—whether true or not.;

- The creature has disadvantage on Insight and Perception checks due to overwhelming suspicion.;
- They cannot benefit from the Help action, and they treat all allies as if they had half cover.;
- If the creature ends its turn alone, it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or use its movement to get closer to the nearest creature, friend or foe.;

If this condition lasts for more than 1 hour, the creature begins to hallucinate phantom observers.;

---

### Bleeding
The creature is suffering from a magical or paranormal wound that won’t close on its own.;

- At the start of each of its turns, the creature takes 1d6 necrotic damage.;
- If the creature is below half its hit point maximum, the damage increases to 2d6.;
- Bleeding ends if the creature receives any healing or succeeds on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.;

Creatures that die while Bleeding leave no corpse—only a red outline etched into the ground.;

---

### Aroused
The creature’s nervous system is overstimulated, flooding it with conflicting signals of pleasure and confusion.;

- The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom and Intelligence saving throws.;
- The creature’s speed is halved.;
- While Aroused, the creature cannot take reactions and has disadvantage on ability checks to maintain concentration.;

If the creature is damaged while Aroused, they must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of their next turn.;
tions, the creature ceases to be fully humanoid and must be cured through an anomaly reversal or similar spell.;
