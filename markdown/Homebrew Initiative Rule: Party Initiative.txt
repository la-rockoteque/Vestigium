# Homebrew Initiative Rule: Party Initiative

:
To streamline combat and emphasize teamwork, all players in the party act on the same initiative count. This rule replaces the standard initiative system in D&D 5e.


:::



### Initiative Roll:
At the start of combat, the party rolls a single initiative check using the highest Dexterity (Initiative) modifier in the group.
The party can also each make an initiative roll and take the higher roll.
The Dungeon Master rolls initiative for enemy groups separately.
Combat Flow:

### Combat Flow:
When the party’s turn arrives, players act in any order they choose. They can discuss tactics, adjust strategies, and decide who acts first.
Once all players have decided on their turns, all the turns resolve. THe party can choose how the turns resolve.

### Conditions & Effects:
If a player is affected by a condition that impacts their initiative (such as being surprised or stunned), they still lose their action on the party’s turn.
Effects that last “until the end of a character’s next turn” end when the party’s next turn ends.
Ready Action Adjustments:

### Ready Action Adjustments:
Players can still use the Ready action, specifying triggers as usual. Triggers can occur at any time during the round.
Surprise Rounds:

### Surprise Rounds:
If the party is surprised, enemies get a full round of actions before the party can act. If only some players are surprised, the rest can act as usual when the party’s turn comes up.
Ties in Initiative:

### Ties in Initiative:
If the party ties with an enemy's initiative, the party acts first unless the enemy has a feature that grants advantage on initiative.
Optional Rule: Dynamic Initiative (Advanced Play)

### Optional Rule: Dynamic Initiative (Advanced Play):
At the start of each round, roll initiative for both the party and enemies again. This creates more dynamic and unpredictable combat.
