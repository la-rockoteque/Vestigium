# The Harvest of Souls: The Mycean Reaction
*"The sky darkened. The sun vanished behind great faces of light. And then, millions were gone."*

The **Harvest of Souls** was the moment when **the Three Visages appeared over Mycea**, blocking out the sun, and **abducting millions of humans in an instant.**  

This **one event was seen differently in Terra and Gaïa**, shaping **how their societies responded, and how they viewed the world afterward.**  

---

# **🔥 The Reaction in Terra: The Great Abduction**
*"This was not a test. This was a war we never saw coming."*

## 🛡️ How Terra Perceived the Harvest
Terra **did not see this as an act of gods**—they saw it as **another invasion.**  
To them, it was **no different from the horrors of the Deadlands, the Hellwar, or the alien conquerors.**  

**Except this time, there was no army. No battle. No warning.**  

Millions of people simply **vanished**, and there was **nothing anyone could do.**  

## 🔺 Terra’s Reactions
- **The Noble Houses** called it **an act of war**, though they had **no idea who the enemy was.**  
- **The Obsidian Oath** feared that it was **the first stage of something much worse—perhaps an attempt to unseal Sachiel.**  
- **The Blood Merchants** saw it as **a cosmic-scale theft of souls**—**those people had not died, but they had been erased.**  
- **The Warlocks of the Hellscar** believed that **the Visages were a new kind of demon, devouring entire bloodlines.**  
- **The Alien Rulers of Terra’s Conquered Lands** feared that **this was a greater power than them—something that even they could not control.**  

⏩ **Terra immediately moved into a state of war.** Even though they **did not understand what had happened, they were determined to fight it.**

## 🔥 The Aftermath in Terra: The Rising Paranoia
After the **Harvest of Souls**, Terra’s society became **fractured by fear.**  

- **Entire noble bloodlines vanished** in an instant, leaving behind empty thrones.  
- **Some cities went into total lockdown**, trying to prevent another mass disappearance.  
- **Many believed the Visages would return**, and so Terra’s remaining forces **began searching for a way to defend against them.**  
- **Some tried to summon them again**, believing **that only by making contact could they understand what happened.**  
- **Others went mad**, seeing visions of the sky filling with faces, whispering that **the Visages would come back for the rest.**  

⏩ **Terra’s war against the unknown had begun.**

# **🌳 The Reaction in Gaïa: The Celestial Judgment**
*"The gods have chosen. We do not know why, but we must have faith."*

## 🕊️ How Gaïa Perceived the Harvest
Unlike Terra, Gaïa did not see the Harvest as **an invasion.**  
To them, it was **a divine event. A celestial judgment. A cosmic reckoning.**  

Gaïa had **no history of war, no great invasions, no scars of conquest.**  
They were **the center of civilization**, the rulers of nature, the blessed of the World Trees.  

And yet, **even they were not spared.**  

## 🔺 Gaïa’s Reactions
- **The Noble Houses of Gaïa** tried to **explain it as a divine selection**—those taken were **either the most worthy or the most sinful.**  
- **The Blood Merchants of Gaïa** saw it as **the balance being broken on a scale never seen before.**  
- **The Vaettir Shrines went silent**—the spirits of nature **refused to speak of what had happened.**  
- **The Followers of the Sun** believed **the Visages were ascended mortals who had found the path beyond life.**  
- **The Floating City Scholars** began studying it as **a cosmic phenomenon, sending expeditions to the high peaks to try and reach where the Visages had appeared.**  

⏩ **Gaïa’s response was not war, but faith.**

## 🔥 The Aftermath in Gaïa: The Rise of New Cults & Divisions
After the **Harvest of Souls**, Gaïa **split into three major belief systems**, each with their own interpretation of what had happened.  

### **1️⃣ The Devout: "We Must Prepare to Ascend."**
- These people **believed that the Visages were gods** who had taken the chosen few to paradise.  
- They **abandoned their old ways**, seeking **a path to enlightenment** so that when the Visages returned, **they would not be left behind.**  

### **2️⃣ The Scholars: "We Must Find the Visages."**
- The **floating cities** and **the last remaining Vaettir** began an **obsession with understanding** the event.  
- They built **observatories, arcane compasses, and sky-sailing ships** in an effort to **find the Visages and demand answers.**  

### **3️⃣ The Fractured: "We Have Been Judged."**
- Many believed **Gaïa had been found unworthy**, and that **the end was coming.**  
- Some **descended into madness**, believing the Visages **would return to erase the rest of humanity.**  

⏩ **Gaïa did not prepare for war. It prepared for the end.**

## 🔥 How These Reactions Shape Future Stories
The **difference between Terra and Gaïa’s responses** creates **two completely different settings** for stories set in the aftermath of the Harvest of Souls.

|------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Belief About the Visages** | A new invading force, a cosmic war has begun | Gods, cosmic judges, or ascended beings |
| **Immediate Action** | Military lockdown, preparing for another attack | Religious, spiritual, and arcane investigations |
| **Paranoia & Fear** | "They will come back for the rest of us." | "We must prepare for when they return." |
