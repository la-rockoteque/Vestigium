                "You briefly attune to the narrative fabric of reality, gaining an uncanny sensitivity to dramatic structure, clichés, and meta-patterns. For the duration, you can sense the presence of common story tropes in characters, environments, and events within range.\n\nYou can detect things like:\n- When a villain is about to monologue\n- If a side character radiates “tragic backstory energy”\n- Whether a room feels “too conveniently empty”\n- If an ancient prophecy is about to become relevant\n- When someone is definitely about to betray the party\n\nThis insight is incredibly annoying to others. NPCs may roll Insight to feel disturbed by your overly convenient genre awareness.\n\nMeta Mechanic (once per casting):\n\nIf the DM becomes visibly annoyed by your observations—subtly or overtly—you may “break the fourth wall.” When this happens:\n- You may ask the DM one question about the current narrative, twist, or character.\n- The DM must answer, but may do so cryptically.\n- Your character forgets the answer consciously, but retains it subconsciously.\n- The player gains one “narrative gut feeling” that can be invoked at any time for advantage on a single Insight, Perception, or Investigation check.\n\nThis ability can only be triggered once per casting.",

Faces, forms, emotions, and gestures emerge from the haze—some familiar, some unknown—each representing a truth they’ve always carried.\n\nThe spell may reveal one or more of the following aspects, depending on your focus:\n\nGender Identity: The target's inner identity manifests briefly as a mirage, affirming their true self. This may reveal identities such as Male, Female, Nonbinary, Transgender, Cisgender, Two-Spirit, Genderfluid, Agender, or something uniquely personal and beyond typical categories.\n\nRomantic Inclination: You awaken a subtle echo within the target’s spirit, reflecting their romantic nature. This might indicate whether they identify as Hyper-Romantic, Romantic, Demi-Romantic, Grayromantic, Aromantic, or something entirely undefined.\n\nSexual Orientation: A fleeting, sensory dreamscape gently unfolds around the target, reflecting their deepest attractions. They may acknowledge, embrace, or gently dismiss these visions. The spell doesn't impose new desires; it simply illuminates those already present.\n\nPosition Preference: A subtle sensation reveals the subject's preferred intimacy position, such as Top, Bottom, Versatile, Vers-Top, Vers-Bottom, Side, or an unclassified, uniquely personal preference.\n\nFetish Affinity: A delicate hum pulses into the subject’s subconscious, drawing forth hidden motifs of pleasure—those they cherish, those they deny, and those that whisper only in dreams. This may reveal affinities such as Bondage, Impact Play, Sensory Deprivation, Exhibitionism, Voyeurism, Power Exchange, Pet Play, or something undocumented by common texts.\n\nKink Role Alignment: A soft whisper coils through the subject’s awareness, coaxing insight into their innate position within dominance-submission dynamics. They may momentarily experience themselves in a state of control, surrender, or fluidity. Whether they resist, acknowledge, or embrace this vision, the spell merely opens a door—it does not push them through it.\n\nThe experience is not invasive—it is affirming, deeply personal, and laced with quiet reverence. The subject may resist this unveiling with a Wisdom saving throw; on a success, the vision remains fragmented, and only a vague sense of their essence slips through.\n\nThis spell does not coerce. It does not judge. It simply illuminates what was already burning softly beneath the surface.",

While using its senses, you are deaf and blind to your own surroundings.- You can communicate telepathically with the familiar while it remains tattooed on you and is conscious.- When you cast a spell with a range of touch, the familiar can deliver the spell through you if the body part bearing the tattoo is used to make contact with the target.- The familiar cannot attack, interact with objects, or move independently from your body. It can crawl across your skin, shifting its location and appearance, but it cannot leave your surface.- The tattoo cannot be removed by mundane means and persists even if you are polymorphed or disguised. If the tattoo is destroyed or erased by magical means (such as dispel magic or a targeted ritual), the familiar is banished and must be recreated by casting this spell again.\n\nThe familiar’s design changes subtly to reflect its emotions or magical stimuli, often revealing moods, warnings, or arcane patterns.\n\nYou can only have one inkbound familiar at a time. Attempting to cast this spell again causes the previous tattoo to fade and the familiar to vanish."

On a failed save, they are flustered until the start of their next turn, suffering disadvantage on Insight and Charisma (Persuasion or Deception) checks.\n\nThe phantom lingers for 1 minute, continuing to flirt—but vanishes immediately if the target accepts a date.\n\nIf the target refuses, ignores, or reacts negatively to the offer during the spell’s duration, they immediately gain 1 level of exhaustion as their heart and sleep are cursed with regret, longing, and dramatic dream interludes.\n\nRestless Charm:\n\nIf the target accepts the date, the illusion disappears with a delighted gasp—but returns during their next long rest, whisking them away on a surreal magical outing.\n- The long rest is interrupted.\n- The target returns in the morning emotionally drained, gaining a level of exhaustion.\n- Additionally, they suffer disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws until their next long rest, as reality feels disappointingly dull compared to their spectral suitor.\n\nIf the target refuses the date, the illusion returns every long rest until they accept, interrupting sleep and causing 1 level of exhaustion each time. The illusion is more dramatic every time it returns.\n\nUpon the 6th refusal the illusion will sip the beauty and vitality from the target incuring in the death of the target."

It simply relocates to the new target, abandoning the old one unless they are still within 30 feet of the new caster, in which case it harasses both.\n- If no suitable target exists: Pest-1 vanishes into non-space until summoned again.\n- If the target becomes untargetable (e.g., invisible, banished): Pest-1 immediately shifts to the next most “important” person in the room.\n- If someone other than the original caster uses the spell: Pest-1 recognizes this and updates its priorities accordingly, often begrudgingly.\n\nMechanical Effect:\nThe affected creature is considered distracted for 1 minute:\n- Disadvantage on concentration checks.\n- Cannot benefit from the Invisible condition.\n- Any attack rolls made against the creature have advantage if they rely on sound or movement (e.g., tremorsense or blindsight)."

This affliction is dormant for three days, during which the target feels no ill effects.- After three days, the disease awakens. Symptoms manifest suddenly, accompanied by whispers of secrets and memories of decay that take hold of the target’s mind. Feverish visions and murmured words plague the afflicted, distorting their perception of reality.- A successful Medicine check reveals nothing unusual at first glance. The symptoms appear natural, as though the disease were always meant to be a part of the target’s life. No magical traces of the rot can be detected without specialized magic or knowledge.\n\nEffect:\nWhile the disease is dormant, the target remains unaware of the affliction. Upon the disease’s awakening, they suffer from both physical and psychological effects, with hallucinations and fever overtaking them. The whispers may speak of forgotten memories, lost opportunities, or cryptic warnings—each whisper an unsettling reflection of the decay inside them.\n\nThe disease is not immediately fatal but can lead to a slow decline in health, eventually debilitating the target unless it is cured.

He is not one for questions and will accept no explanation or excuses, only calling it “business.”\n\nThe tough guy has the following characteristics:- Personality quirks:\n\t1.\tRefers to you as “kid” and insists on using streetwise jargon.\n\t2.\tLights a cigar during combat and complains about how things used to be better.\n\t3.\tWill break someone’s kneecaps or deliver a threatening glare in exchange for gold.\n\t4.\tMakes vague references to “debts” that the caster “owes” him, but never elaborates.\n\t5.\tWill disappear without a word once the spell ends, often in a puff of smoke, with a brief “yeah, yeah, alright” if given a sandwich.\n\nCombat role: The tough guy is proficient in melee combat, dealing 1d6 + Charisma modifier impact damage per attack. He follows basic combat tactics, focusing on protecting you or the group, but is self-serving and won’t risk his life for anyone’s cause unless it directly benefits him. He will act once in combat, and his loyalty ends as soon as the fight is over.\n\nAdditional effects:- He insists on being paid in gold, and if not, he may hold grudges that result in negative consequences for future interactions.- After the fight concludes, the mobster vanishes mysteriously, leaving behind a feeling of “unfinished business.”"

Choose one creature within range; \nit must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target suffers the following effects:\n- The target takes 4d8 distortive damage as their identity begins to fracture, leaving a hollow, ceramic\n-like resonance within their being.- They become a “Husk”: For the next hour, the target struggles to remember their own name, imposing disadvantage on all Charisma-based checks and saving throws.\n\nMarked by the Void (Caster’s Consequences):\nEvery time you cast this spell, you become subtly marked by the magic. The mark grows stronger with repeated uses. You experience minor, unsettling phenomena:\n- Your reflection occasionally blinks or moves independently.\n- Your shadow periodically misaligns or lags behind your physical form.\n\nAfter you cast this spell 3 or more times, you gain disadvantage on Charisma saving throws until you complete a long rest, as the magic slowly erodes your own identity.\n\nThese effects are cumulative but subtle enough to be hidden from casual observers—though those familiar with the Void’s whispers will recognize your affliction immediately.\n\nRemoving the Mark:\nA Greater Restoration or similarly potent cleansing magic removes all accumulated marks from you, resetting the count."

Instead of communicating directly, you witness fractured memories or emotional imprints they left behind.\n\nWhen cast on a space where a humanoid died within the last 7 days, choose one of the following effects:\n\n- Residual Vision. You and up to 5 willing creatures see a ghostly reenactment of the creature’s final moments, projected like a spectral recording. The scene is silent and incomplete, but may reveal useful visual details such as a killer's face, a hidden object, or a symbol drawn in blood.\n  \n- Lingering Instinct. You gain a skill or tool proficiency the deceased possessed (your choice, if known) for 10 minutes. You also gain advantage on Intelligence checks related to the creature's past profession or knowledge.\n\n- Emotional Imprint. The space is saturated with the creature's strongest emotion at the time of death. For 10 minutes, anyone entering the space must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or experience that emotion intensely (e.g., rage, fear, sorrow), which may affect social interactions, Insight, or Intimidation checks.\n\nThe echo fades once the chosen effect ends, or if dismissed early."

On a success, they take half damage and suffer no additional effect.\n\nOnce per round for the duration (1 round), the melody echoes faintly again at initiative count 0.

Until the spell fails, it counts as “being cast,” preventing the caster from concentrating on another spell if it required concentration. You may only have one spell delayed by A.S.T.R.A.L.

Affected creatures must make a Constitution saving throw or suffer the selected effect.\n\nAt the end of each of their turns, affected creatures must repeat the saving throw. On two failed saves, the target becomes Stunned until the end of their next turn as the olfactory hallucination overwhelms their nervous system.\n\nChoose one scent effect upon casting:\n\nRot and Filth: Targets that fail their save are Poisoned and suffer disadvantage on saving throws against charm and fear effects for the duration .\n\nSweet Perfume: Targets must succeed on a Wisdom save or be Charmed by you until the end of that turn.\n\nBurnt Ozone: On a failed save, targets cannot take reactions until the start of their next turn and The creature has disadvantage on Perception and Insight checks.\n\nYou may use a bonus action on your turn to change the scent’s directionality (e.g., from everywhere to a specific direction).\n\nThe illusion lingers for 1 minute, and affected creatures must repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns. On a success, the effect ends for them.\n\nCondition Synergy: If a target is already Frightened, Charmed, or Poisoned when affected, it has disadvantage on the initial saving throw.\n\nObscured Battlefield: While under the spell’s effect, affected creatures are considered heavily obscured to others—they constantly shift position in reaction to the scent, creating a surreal mirage-like presence. This effect ends if the scent illusion ends.\n\nAdditionally, while the spell is active, you may use an action to cause the scent to mimic a recognizable compound—such as smoke, fuel, or blood—potentially triggering scent-based detection systems or distracting creatures with scent-based senses."

This knot pulses with an unnatural green glow, visible only in reflections and peripheral vision.\n\nWhile under the effects of this spell, the creature gains the following benefits:\n\n- Last Stand Ward: The next time the creature would fall to 0 hit points, they instead regain 3d10 + your spellcasting modifier hit points, immediately stand upright without using movement, and are immune to being reduced to 0 HP again until the end of their next turn. The spell then ends.\n- Defiance of Death: Until the ward is triggered, the target cannot gain the *Unconscious* or *Paralysed* conditions.  \n- Aura of Persistence: Allies within 10 feet gain advantage on saving throws against effects that would cause *Frightened*, *Paralysed*, or *Charmed*.\n\nIf the ward is not triggered within the spell’s duration, the energy fades—leaving behind a faint green sigil burned into the target’s aura, visible only to the dead."

                "You issue a sanctioned directive that targets the body itself—its fluids, its functions, its very architecture. The spell sends a binding sigil through the bloodstream of one creature within range, turning their own vital systems against them.\n\nThe target must make a Constitution saving throw.\n\n- On a failure, their blood ignites with administrative intent, warping to fulfill the directive. They take 10d10 biologic damage, and for the duration, they are affected by Internal Rebellion (see below).\n- On a success, the target takes half damage and is not otherwise affected.\n\nInternal Rebellion:  \nFor the duration of the spell, the creature suffers the following effects:\n- Hemorrhagic Pulses: At the start of each of their turns, roll 1d6. On a 1–3, they take 3d6 biologic damage as their blood attempts to exit through eyes, ears, and pores.  \n- Command Override: The caster may use a bonus action on their turn to force the target to use half their movement in a direction of the caster’s choosing, as their own muscle tissue spasms against them.  \n- Hostile System Rejection: If the target attempts to cast a spell or take a reaction, they must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw or the action fails and they take 2d6 psychic damage.\n\nIf this spell reduces a creature to 0 hit points, their body implodes into mist and splinters of bone, leaving behind no remains.\n"
